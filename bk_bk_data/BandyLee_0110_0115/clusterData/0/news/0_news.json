        "body": "Now, that\u2019s ironic. It turns out that the Yale professor/psychiatrist who diagnosed Trump as crazy, doesn\u2019t have a valid license in her home state of Connecticut. Allegations, accusations and rumors started swarming on Twitter about this woman. Bandy Lee also just deleted her Twitter account. All of this stems from her making an unethical diagnosis of President Trump as mentally unstable and then meeting with a dozen Democrats last December over it. She even said he should be physically removed from office and committed. That\u2019s called a coup.\n\nFollowing Lee\u2019s comments, the American Psychiatric Association released a statement on Tuesday warning members of its profession to refrain from making public diagnoses of public figures like Trump without a proper medical exam. She has never even met the President, so Lee violated the Goldwater Rule big time here. The Goldwater rule is the informal name given to Section 7 in the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s (APA) Principles of Medical Ethics that states it is unethical for psychiatrists to give a professional opinion about public figures they have not examined in person and from whom they have not obtained consent to discuss their mental health in public statements. It is named after presidential candidate Barry Goldwater.\n\n\u201cWe at the APA call for an end to psychiatrists providing professional opinions in the media about public figures whom they have not examined, whether it be on cable news appearances, books, or in social media,\u201d wrote the APA, without mentioning Lee specifically. \u201cArm-chair psychiatry or the use of psychiatry as a political tool is the misuse of psychiatry and is unacceptable and unethical.\u201d Lee is back-pedaling on this as fast as she can now, but it\u2019s too late for her. Perhaps it will be a lesson to other so-called mental health professionals who decide to mix politics with their profession.\n\nLee and her colleague responded to the issue in a piece to Politico on Wednesday, in which they claimed it is \u201cperfectly okay to question the President\u2019s mental state\u201d because of their profession as \u201cpsychiatrists.\u201d No, it is not. Not even if she was actually licensed and the APA backs me up on this. According to Campus Reform, state records indicate that Lee\u2019s \u201cphysician/surgeon\u201d license expired some three years ago \u2014 on May 31, 2015 \u2014 and that her application for reinstatement has been pending ever since. The publication was able to produce Lee\u2019s license details to back up the claim.\n\nAlso at issue here is Lee\u2019s \u201ccontrolled substance registration for practitioner\u201d license that has also lapsed, having expired last February. In other words, Lee is not legally able to prescribe medication as a medical practitioner. When responding to Campus Reform, Lee stated, \u201cI only need one license.\u201d She did not clarify precisely what license she has, or in which state she is registered. After this public mess, her license is unlikely to be renewed. And it shouldn\u2019t be.",

Lee\u00a0and Harvard\u2019s Judith Herman and Columbia\u2019s Robert Jay Lifton. The three recently released a statement warning that Trump is \u201cfurther unraveling,\u201d despite the fact that they\u2019ve never actually examined the president.\n\nLee even claimed failure to address President Trump\u2019s declining mental-health state could lead to \u201cthe extinction of the human species.\u201d\n\nSince her calls for evaluation and restraint of Trump were made public, Lee has deleted her Twitter account. Users of the site have claimed she\u2019s not even a licensed psychiatrist.\n\nLee\u2019s \u201cphysician/surgeon\u201d license\u00a0 in Connecticut expired\u00a0on May 31,\u00a02015, Campus Reform reported. Her reinstatement application has been \u201cpending\u201d for more than two years.\n\nCampus Reform also noted that Lee\u2019s \u201ccontrolled substance registration for practitioner\u201d license \u201clapsed,\u201d expiring in February 2017.\n\nWhen the site questioned Lee about the licenses, she replied: \u201cI need only one license.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has yet to elaborate on precisely which license that is, and, according to the state in which she resides, she allegedly has none,\u201d reported Campus Reform.\n\nLee, who previously claimed the three are not \u201cdiagnosing\u201d the president, said, \u201cWe are mainly concerned that an emergency evaluation be done.\u201d\n\nShe told Vox.com she\u2019s concerned that if Trump is having a mental breakdown, the situation could lead to U.S. military action against North Korea and a nuclear holocaust.\n\n\u201c[T]hat is not the only danger we\u2019re facing,\u201d Lee insisted. \u201cThere\u2019s everything in between: provoking our allies and alienating them, instigating civil conflict, and laying a foundation for a violent culture that could give way to epidemics of violence \u2014 not to mention poke a beehive in the Middle East by declaring Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital. All of these actions are consistent with the pathological pattern he has already shown of resorting to violence the more he feels threatened.\u201d\n\nLee even insisted no \u201cserious\u201d psychiatrist would say Trump isn\u2019t \u201cdangerous.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would be hard to find a single psychiatrist, no matter of what political affiliation, who could confidently say Trump is not dangerous,\u201d she said. \u201cI am sure there are some who feel unsure, or feel that they don\u2019t have enough information or the expertise, and that is fine, since not everyone has devoted her 20-year career to studying, predicting, and preventing violence like I have. But there has not been a single serious mental health expert who disagrees on the medical side.\u201d\n\nHow can psychiatrists evaluate President Trump if he won\u2019t voluntarily submit to an evaluation?\n\nLee suggested a forceful evaluation, but she warned it could \u201creally look like a coup\u201d:\n\nWe encounter this often in mental health. Those who most require an evaluation are the least likely to submit to one. That is the reason why in all 50 states we have not only the legal authority, but often the legal obligation, to contain someone even against their will when it\u2019s an emergency. So in an emergency, neither consent nor confidentiality requirements hold. Safety comes first. What we do in the case of danger is we contain the person, we remove them from access to weapons, and we do an urgent evaluation. This is what we have been calling for with the president based on basic medical standards of care. Surprisingly, many lawyer groups have actually volunteered, on their own, to file for a court paper to ensure that the security staff will cooperate with us. But we have declined, since this will really look like a coup, and while we are trying to prevent violence, we don\u2019t wish to incite it through, say, an insurrection.\n\nLee said she has been discussing this scenario with lawmakers on Capitol Hill, and they \u201cseem surprisingly OK\u201d with what she had to say.\n\nAs WND reported last July, it has long been considered\u00a0unethical for psychiatrists to \u201cdiagnose\u201d politicians or public figures\u00a0based solely on that person\u2019s public actions or statements, without conducting an actual in-person\u00a0examination. But now that Trump is president, a national psychology organization, the American Psychoanalytic Association, has given psychoanalysts the green light to publicly comment on Trump\u2019s mental health.\n\nSince Lee\u2019s statements were made public, the American Psychiatric Association released a statement urging psychiatrists to stop trying to evaluate Trump when they\u2019ve never even examined him.\n\n\u201cWe at the APA call for an end to psychiatrists providing professional opinions in the media about public figures whom they have not examined, whether it be on cable news appearances, books, or in social media,\u201d the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s statement said. \u201cArm-chair psychiatry or the use of psychiatry as a political tool is the misuse of psychiatry and is unacceptable and unethical.\u201d\n\nAs WND reported, without ever having examined Trump, psychological professionals have called the president\u00a0\u201cpsychotic,\u201d \u201cnarcissistic,\u201d \u201cparanoid,\u201d \u201chypomanic,\u201d\u00a0\u201cemotionally  isolated\u201d\u00a0and claimed he has a\u00a0\u201cdangerous mental illness.\u201d\u00a0One physician suggested Trump could be suffering from an\u00a0untreated sexually transmitted disease known as neurosyphilis.\n\nSome mental health \u201cexperts\u201d have even gone so far as to\u00a0call conservatism a mental illness, claiming prominent Republicans have shown signs of\u00a0denial, delusion, hallucination, disordered thinking, anger, anti-social behavior, sexual preoccupation, grandiosity, general oddness and paranoia.\n\nIn a Politico piece Wednesday, \u201cWe\u2019re psychiatrists.

It was a show that had a few pundits and White House reporters,\u00a0once again, cooing about Trump\u2019s \u201ccapability,\u201d which some of them implied disproved the allegations in the book \u2015 largely because they\u2019ve lowered the bar so much\u00a0for Trump. This, even though Trump contradicted himself throughout the meeting, baffling viewers about his actual positions, and sending\u00a0conservative commentators into a tailspin when he appeared to side momentarily with Democrats on comprehensive immigration reform.\nNear the weeks\u2019s end, however,\u00a0Trump undid whatever little bit of rehabilitation he had achieved, when, according to people in the room, including Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), the president railed\u00a0against immigrants from \u201cshithole countries\u201d and said that he preferred immigrants from places \u201clike Norway.\u201d (The White House didn\u2019t deny the report, first published in The Washington Post Thursday afternoon, though over 18 hours later Trump\u00a0suggested it wasn\u2019t true\u00a0in a tweet.) The blow up occurred at a bipartisan private meeting of lawmakers on Thursday in which Trump clearly couldn\u2019t control his contempt for people of color. He proved himself to be every bit like the depictions of him in Fire and Fury.\n\nThe debate about Trump\u2019s emotional stability ended a long time ago.\n\n\nToo many people, including many in the media and even Trump himself, have confused mental impairment and emotional stability.\nPeople can of course be mentally ill and yet quite stable. And there are many people who aren\u2019t in any way mentally impaired, but are highly emotionally unstable \u2015 prone to outbursts, impulsiveness, temper tantrums and other erratic behavior that often displays their anger, resentment and animus toward groups or individuals.\nIn Fire And Fury,\u00a0Wolff quoted people in the White House\u00a0calling\u00a0Trump an \u201cidiot\u201d and a \u201cmoron.\u201d He wrote\u00a0that people around Trump describe him\u00a0as as being \u201clike a child\u201d and that \u201c100 percent\u201d of them believe he is not \u201cfit\u201d for office.

        "title": "Let's get a physical! Trump, 71, gets first checkup but no psych eval",
        "body": "Donald Trump will submit himself for his first health checkup as president this afternoon.\n\nThe 71-year-old will be assessed at Walter Reed Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, by Navy doctor Ronny Jackson, a holdover from the previous administration.\n\nTrump will not undergo a psychological evaluation today in spite of a pervasive belief among his critics that's spread to voters that he's unfit to sit in the Oval Office.\n\nThe White House said yesterday that Jackson will release a statement on Trump's health today and provide an in-depth diagnostic update after Trump returns from a three-day holiday.\n\nAfter his physical this afternoon, Trump will leave Washington for Palm Beach, where he'll remain through Martin Luther King Jr. Day.\n\nTrump will honor the civil rights movement hero this morning with a proclamation.\n\nYesterday, Trump predicted his first health checkup by a military physician would go 'very well.' Adding,\u00a0'I'll be very\u00a0surprised if it doesn't.'\n\nThen he quipped: 'It better go well otherwise the stock market will not be happy,' linking his own health to the Wall Street's boom.\n\nAnd in a new demonstration of transparency, Jackson will head to the White House Tuesday to take questions from reporters about the president's health.\n\n'He\u2019ll join me here on Tuesday to give a detailed readout of the president\u2019s exam and then answer a few questions from you guys,' said White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders at her daily press briefing.\n\nTrump is getting his first medical checkup since taking office, a head-to-toe exam on Friday as questions swirl about the health and fitness of the oldest person ever elected to the nation's highest office.\n\nIn advance, the 71-year-old president has pushed back vigorously against suggestions he's mentally unfit, declaring himself 'a very stable genius.'\n\nThat followed the release of a new book, 'Fire and Fury,' that maintains his close advisors have doubts about his mental fitness for office.\n\nTrump's personal physician, Dr. Harold Bornstein, famously released a letter during the campaign that pronounced Trump to be the healthiest person ever to hold office.\n\n'If elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency,' wrote Bornstein, who provided care for Trump for 35 years.\n\n'His health is excellent, especially his mental health,' Bornstein told NBC afterward.\n\nTrump raised concern last month when he slurred some words on national TV. When asked about it, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said questions about Trump's health were 'frankly, pretty ridiculous' and blamed his slurred speech on a dry throat, 'nothing more than that.'\n\nMore questions have been raised in the weeks since, given the tone of some of his tweets and the reported comments of some of the people who deal with him day to day. Some were recently published in a new book about his first year, which Sanders denounced as 'complete fantasy' for its portrayal of Trump as undisciplined, child-like and in over his head.\n\nTrump was 70 when he was inaugurated a year ago to handle the 24/7 demands of being president. Ronald Reagan, who served two terms, was a year younger when he took office in 1981.\n\nTrump took the unusual step of threatening legal action to try to suppress publication of 'Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,' by Michael Wolff. He then drew even more attention to the book and the debate about his fitness with weekend tweets stating that his two greatest assets in life 'have been mental stability and being, like, really smart.' Trump noted his success in business, reality TV and presidential politics, saying: 'I think that would qualify as not smart, but genius ... and a very stable genius at that!'\n\nThe president is to fly by helicopter Friday afternoon to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center outside Washington in Bethesda, Maryland, for the exam.\n\nThere is no requirement for a president to have a physical, but modern officeholders undergo them regularly and release a doctor's report stating that they are 'fit to serve.'\n\nTrump will not undergo a psychiatric exam, the White House said. Officials did not address a different type of screening, assessments of cognitive status that examine neurologic functions including memory. Cognitive assessments aren't routine in standard physicals, although they recently became covered in Medicare's annual wellness visits for seniors.\n\nDr. Ronny L. Jackson, a Navy rear admiral who is the president's official physician and director of the White House Medical Unit, is coordinating the exam. Jackson provided care for President Barack Obama, conducting and supervising the last of three physicals Obama had during his eight years in office.\n\nHow much of Trump's health information the public gets to see is up to him, but Sanders said she expects him to release the same kind of details as past presidents.\n\nIn September 2016, during the presidential campaign, Trump released a five-paragraph letter from Dr. Harold Bornstein, his longtime physician, in which the gastroenterologist concluded that Trump 'is in excellent physical health.' A year earlier, Bornstein said in a December 2015 letter: 'If elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.'\n\nThe 2016 letter put Trump's blood pressure and cholesterol measurements in the healthy range, but he does use a cholesterol-lowering statin medication. His EKG, chest X-ray, echocardiogram and blood sugar were normal. The 6-foot-3 Trump weighed 236 pounds, and his body mass index, or BMI, of 29.5 put him in the category of being overweight for his height.\n\nTrump takes Crestor for his cholesterol, a low-dose aspirin for heart attack prevention, Propecia to treat male-pattern baldness and antibiotics for rosacea. The one-page letter stated Trump's testosterone level, 441.6, was in the normal range, as were his PSA reading for prostate abnormalities and tests of his liver and thyroid.\n\nTrump leads a largely sedentary lifestyle compared to his most recent predecessors, who ran, rode mountain bikes, played basketball or used exercise machines and lifted weights, and were significantly younger than him when they took office. Trump has said he gets most of his exercise from playing golf, which he does most weekends, driving a cart instead of walking from hole to hole.\n\nFederal health guidelines urge people over age 65 who have no health conditions that would limit exercise to get about 2\u00bd hours a week of moderate activity, such as brisk walking, and to do some muscle-strengthening activities at least two days a week.\n\nAs for his diet, Trump enjoys fast food, steaks well-done and with ketchup, chocolate cake and double scoops of vanilla ice cream, and reportedly downs 12 Diet Cokes a day. In a series of interviews last year, Trump showed journalists how he summons a butler to bring him a soda by pressing a red button on his Oval Office desk. In a recent book, 'Let Trump Be Trump,' former top campaign aides Corey Lewandowski and David Bossie described the four major food groups on Trump's campaign plane as 'McDonald's, Kentucky Fried Chicken, pizza and Diet Coke.'\n\nDemocratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland introduced a bill in April to create a commission that would study whether the president was mentally or physically unable to perform his duties. Democrat Zoe Lofgren of California followed in August with a resolution urging the vice president and Cabinet to have Trump undergo exams to assess his competence. Neither measure has advanced in Congress.\n\nWhite House officials pushed back Monday against a report by the Axios news website that Trump has been starting his official days later and holding fewer meetings than earlier in his presidency. Spokesman Hogan Gidley said Trump 'exhibits yeoman-like work every day in this job, whether it be up before dawn and up into the wee hours of the morning every day.'\n\nOn Tuesday, the White House made a point of opening Trump's lengthy immigration meeting with lawmakers to reporters and TV cameras, a rare public look lasting nearly an hour at the president conducting a policy gathering.\n\nTrump friend Chris Ruddy, head of the conservative news site NewsMax, says he does not know the details of Trump's schedule but 'the idea that he's some sort of absentee president is ludicrous.'\n\nBarbara Perry, director of presidential studies at the University of Virginia's Miller Center, said, 'There's a long history in the presidency of presidents hiding their medical infirmities, both as candidates and as presidents.'\n\nGrover Cleveland secretly had part of a cancerous jaw removed aboard a yacht in 1893 when he was said to be on a fishing trip. During the 1960 election, John F. Kennedy concealed that he suffered from a variety of conditions, including Addison's disease, which he controlled with steroids and other drugs. Woodrow Wilson had a secret stroke.\n\nPerry said, 'In the nuclear age, our lives are in the hands of our presidents. I think the American people should know everything there is to know about a president's mental and physical health.'",

This made the researchers refer to the phenomenon as \"fault-free obesity.\"\n\nAnother previous study \u2014 led by Prof. Philippe Froguel, who is chair of genomic medicine at Imperial College London (ICL) in the United Kingdom \u2014 found that variants in three genes accounted for 30 percent of the severe obesity cases identified in a Pakistani population.\n\nThe same team of ICL researchers have now chosen to focus on a group of Pakistani children with extreme obesity from consanguineous families, or those that descend from the same ancestor, in an attempt to single out a specific gene mutation.\n\nAs the authors of the new study explain, so-called recessive mutations are responsible for the link between obesity and genes. Recessive inheritance occurs when both copies of the gene \u2014 that is, from both parents \u2014 have the mutation, and this is more likely to occur when a child's parents are closely related.\n\nSo, Prof. Froguel and colleagues used genome sequencing in Pakistani children because people in this region are more likely to form consanguineous marriages, and the resulting children are more likely to have recessive mutations.\n\nThe new study \u2014 which was recently published in the journal Nature Genetics \u2014 suggests that mutations in a gene called adenylate cyclase 3 (ADCY3) lead to obesity.\n\nAccording to the authors, mutations in this gene \u2014 which is normally responsible for encoding the protein of the same name \u2014 causes changes in functions such as appetite regulation and the olfactory sense.\n\nAs Prof. Froguel explains, \"Early studies into ADCY3 tested mice that were bred to lack that gene, found that these animals were obese and also lacked the ability to smell, known as anosmia.\"\n\nAs expected, they found the same ADCY3 mutation in children. Also, as Prof. Froguel explains, \"When we tested our patients, we found that they also had anosmia, again showing a link to mutations in ADCY3.\"\n\nAdditionally, using the GeneMatcher website, Prof. Froguel and colleagues found another patient \u2014 this time of European-American descent \u2014 who had inherited different ADCY3 mutations from both parents and who also had obesity.\n\nTogether, the study authors conclude, \"These findings highlight ADCY3 as an important mediator of energy homeostasis and an attractive pharmacological target in the treatment of obesity.\"\n\nKnowing precisely which genetic mutations lead to obesity will enable researchers to come up with drugs that target these mutations specifically, the authors explain.",

When asked about the future of his relationship with Steve Bannon, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what the word permanent means.\u201d)\n\nThe most puzzling remarks concerned North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. \u201cI probably have a very good relationship with Kim Jong-un,\u201d Trump told the paper. \u201cI have relationships with people. I think you people are surprised.\u201d\n\nIndeed, people were surprised, and not just at the fact that Trump has connections of some nature with other human beings. Trump has dubbed the North Korean leader \u201cRocket Man,\u201d and called him a \u201cmaniac,\u201d a \u201cmadman,\u201d a \u201cbad dude,\u201d and a \u201csick puppy.\u201d In November he mocked his looks, suggesting he\u2019s \u201cshort and fat,\u201d and ten days ago he declared his \u201cnuclear button\u201d is \u201cmuch bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!\u201d In addition to threatening the U.S. with nuclear annihilation on numerous occasions, Kim has gone after Trump personally as well, vowing in September to \u201ctame the mentally deranged U.S. dotard with fire.\u201d\n\nSo why did Trump suggest he and Kim might be pals now? Here are some theories.\n\n1) Trump talked to Kim and they patched things up. \n\nTrump\u2019s remarks suggested a turnaround so startling that the Journal asked if the president has had some communications with the dictator that the world is not aware of. Trump offered this cryptic reply: \u201cI don\u2019t want to comment on it. I\u2019m not saying I have or haven\u2019t. I just don\u2019t want to comment.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. has not had formal talks with North Korea in a decade. In May Trump said he would be \u201chonored\u201d to meet with Kim, and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has indicated that there are back channel discussions between the two countries, saying, \u201cWe have lines of communication to Pyongyang \u2014 we\u2019re not in a dark situation, a blackout.\u201d\n\nBut in all likelihood, Trump did not pick up the phone and give Kim a call. When asked if the president has spoken to the dictator, a senior administration official told CNN, \u201cThat\u2019s not something we would discuss but we are not aware this contact has occurred.\u201d\n\n2) Trump is signaling that he\u2019s willing to negotiate.\n\nTrump\u2019s remarks were published under the headline \u201cDonald Trump Signals Openness to North Korea Diplomacy in Interview,\u201d which gives the impression that they were part of some coherent strategy.\n\nIt\u2019s possible Trump is trying to send the message that he embraces North Korea\u2019s new attempts at diplomacy. After Kim expressed a desire for \u201cpeaceful resolution with our southern border\u201d in his New Year\u2019s address, the two sides engaged in talks for the first time in years.\n\nTrump said he thinks it\u2019s good that North Korea will be participating in the upcoming Olympic games in South Korea, and that U.S.-South Korea military exercises have been postponed until after the games. But he acknowledged suspicions that North Korea is just trying to drive a wedge between the U.S. and its ally South Korea.\n\n\u201cIf I were them, I would try,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe difference is I\u2019m president, other people aren\u2019t,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd I know more about wedges than any human being that\u2019s lived.\u201d\n\n3) Some of his best friends are his bitter enemies.\n\nLater in the interview, Trump suggested that even if he and Kim don\u2019t have a great relationship right now, that may change very soon. Not because they\u2019ve talked, or because that\u2019s the new U.S. strategy \u2013 that\u2019s just the strange nature of being friends with Trump.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see that a lot with me,\u201d he said of his mean tweets, \u201cand then all of the sudden somebody\u2019s my best friend. I could give you 20 examples. You could give me 30. I\u2019m a very flexible person.\u201d\n\nTo give just one example, during the campaign, Trump branded his opponent Senator Ted Cruz as \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted,\u201d questioned his citizenship, threatened to \u201cspill the beans\u201d on his wife, suggested she\u2019s ugly, and insinuated that his father may have helped killed JFK. Cruz ultimately decided to endorse Trump, and now he attacks other Republicans for their disloyalty to the president.\n\nPresident Trump and Rocket Man will be admiring the size of each other\u2019s nukes in no time.",

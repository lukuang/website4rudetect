        "body": "I am the editor of \u201cThe Dangerous Case of Donald Trump: 27 Psychiatrists and Mental Health Experts Assess a President.\u201d I, along with thousands of other mental health professionals, believe in our expert opinion that Donald Trump, in the office of the presidency, is a risk to national and international security.\n\nThis is not a diagnosis. It is an attempt to educate the nation about what we strongly believe to be true, so that the public can demand an objective evaluation of Trump\u2019s mental capacity. A capacity exam doesn\u2019t decide who can or cannot be President; it ensures that whoever is President is capable of carrying out the vital functions the people elected him to carry out.\n\nEverywhere I go, I am assumed to be a Democrat, just for issuing a warning about a President who happens to be Republican. I have never been a Democrat and have no desire to become one. I would behave identically regarding a Democratic President with the same objective signs.\n\nI am a physician and forensic psychiatrist who has been invited many times to testify for state and international governments about violence prevention. Never has it occurred to me to consider which party I was testifying for.\n\nMy primary concern is with enhancing life and reducing death. Health and disease are not difficult to tell apart: One leads to flourishing and life, regardless of ideology or party, while the other leads to damage, destruction and death.\n\nYet sadly, my words have been drawn into the cauldron of politics. In recent months, since my first public warnings about the President\u2019s dangerousness due to mental instability, various lawmakers reached out to me.\n\nAs an influential former Congress member took steps to arrange for me, eventually, to testify before all of Congress, I prepared testimony.\n\nHowever, with time, the resistance of Republican lawmakers became obvious. The testimony before a bipartisan committee has not happened and is not likely to. While it kept being postponed, an impatient former assistant U.S. attorney and former prosecutor drew on her own contacts and arranged for me to meet with 11 members of Congress privately.\n\nThey were all Democrats. No matter how hard she tried, Republican lawmakers\u2019 doors remained shut.\n\nMeanwhile, while I was on Capitol Hill, several laypeople, previously unknown to me, were on a campaign to deliver a copy of our book to every member of Congress. The attorney coordinating this used her contacts to have me meet with key Republican staffers that day in a half-dozen offices.\n\nIt was by happenstance that we ran into one Republican senator, who was returning to the office where I had already met with staffers. Upon hearing the topic, the effort not to engage was palpable.\n\nContrast this to the Democratic lawmakers: They would not have minded meeting in a large group, and three of the offices have even released their names to the press.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to convince us; we have been so concerned ourselves, we were eager to meet with you,\u201d was a common answer. One lawmaker said: \u201cI have never so waited for a meeting in 11 years!\u201d\n\nConcern, they said, was universal among Democrats. Several said they knew of Republican lawmakers who shared their concerns, perhaps equally, but could not express it.\n\nThis discovery was troubling: If bipartisan concern about the President\u2019s mental capacity is real, yet some members of Congress are stifling their worries for political reasons, then what does that say about our nation\u2019s security?\n\nDemocratic lawmakers charged us instead: \u201cKeep doing what you are doing: Educate the public! We ourselves cannot do anything without the public\u2019s support.\u201d And so, I began actively interviewing with the media.\n\nAlong the way, I experienced firsthand an even more troubling phenomenon: the push to mischaracterize my words to grind an ideological ax.\n\nIn one instance, I picked up a phone call to speak with a reporter at an outlet unknown to me. I agreed to the interview, which was hostile from the start. Out of it came a wildly speculative article built around assumptions and associations \u2014 for instance, contorting taking my respect for confidentiality as a courtesy to Republicans as something secretive and subversive.\n\nMy life\u2019s work is understanding the human mind as best as I can, the better to prevent people from physical harm. That is my sole objective in seeking independent psychiatric evaluation of the President.\n\nWhenever there is a sickness, in the body or the mind or the body politic, there is a countering force that \u201ckicks in\u201d \u2014 an immune reaction, if you will \u2014 that fights for the recovery of health. In the midst of an uphill battle, I hope that the lawmakers who have found it hard to do so will find the courage to join that impetus and to fulfill their duty to protect us.",

        "title": "The problem isn't Trump's brain. It's his heart",
        "body": "Michael D'Antonio is the author of \" Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success \" (St. Martin's Press). The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\n\n(CNN) During an hourlong performance Tuesday at a table crowded with lawmakers -- let's call it The President Show -- Donald Trump appeared determined to prove two things. The first was obvious: After much speculation about his temperament, inspired by the dark portrait painted in the book \"Fire and Fury,\" he no doubt wanted to show himself to be an executive in command of the issues and fit to govern. The second was that he is a good man with a warm heart.\n\nIn Trump's eyes, the meeting was a huge success. On Wednesday, he said at his first Cabinet meeting of 2018, that the session a day earlier was a \"tremendous meeting\" and that it got \"great reviews.\"\n\nIn truth, in the role of executive, Trump should get three out of five stars because he spoke calmly and didn't insult anyone.\n\nHowever he showed little understanding of the immigration issues he was supposed to discuss and seemed to abandon his own bargaining position. He even embraced the role of a figurehead who would do whatever Congress dictates as he promised that, if \"this group and others from the Senate, from the House, comes back with an agreement, I'm signing it.\"\n\nTrump's turn in the role as good-hearted man was marked by lines like, \"Truly, it should be a bill of love, and we can do that.\" He was referring to devising a plan that would protect from deportation 800,000 young immigrants who live under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.\n\nWhat he didn't say was that he personally set in motion the cruel policy that would begin their deportation in March, and that he campaigned for president by repeating anti-immigrant slurs that tapped into prejudice with dangerous results -- as in the case of two brothers who attacked a Latino man in Boston, with one of them later telling police, \"Donald Trump was right, all these illegals need to be deported.\"\n\nThe word \"love\", as voiced by Donald Trump, has a strange tone. It's like listening to a first-day student repeat after the instructor in a foreign language class. You recognize the words, but not the feeling behind them.\n\nHe sounded similarly off-key last autumn when he talked about how he \"loved\" Puerto Rico when he visited after Hurricane Maria. In fact he met few actual victims of the storm and his administration's response to the island's needs lacked the energy (read \"love\") shown for the people of Texas and Florida in similar circumstances.\n\nSimilarly, a President who has said he loves \"all the people of our country\" has proven to be a most divisive figure, picking winners and losers in everything from tax policy (sorry residents of Democratic-leaning \"Blue\" states) to civil rights issues. He loudly imagined talking about a generic protesting athlete as a \"son of a bitch.\"And, quite bizarrely, Trump followed up his many acid remarks about US intelligence agencies by telling people at the Central Intelligence Agency , \"I just wanted to really say that I love you, I respect you.\"\n\nAltogether, Trump's attempt at self-revealing comments, whether he's voicing the love in his heart for some people, or his hatred for others, like protesters and members of the press, depict a man whose emotional declarations seem manipulative, staged, and hollow.\n\nHis most authentic expressions of feeling seem to come when he's angry or mocking. In those moments, it's easy to hear that he means what he says. However when he tries to show warmth, he is far less convincing and his motivations are transparent.\n\nWhen he visited the CIA at the start of his presidency Trump was trying to repair the damage done as he denigrated intelligence agencies and faced the prospect of trying to carry out policy with a bureaucracy he had savaged. His expressions of concern for the DACA \"dreamers\" comes as much of America worries about the fate of these young people and their deportation looms as a remarkable act of heartlessness.\n\nBesides a general desire to be seen as more humane, Trump hinted Tuesday at another reason why he would want to appear warmer and more congenial. This he revealed when asked about the potential presidential candidacy of media-mogul Oprah Winfrey, who sparked talk of a run with a speech at the Golden Globes awards ceremony. In that speech, Winfrey hit many of the themes Barack Obama struck when he burst on the national scene in 2004 and she inspired a viral #Oprah2020 online movement.\n\nTrump came alive when asked about Oprah's potential, saying, \"I know her very well. You know I did one of her last shows. She had Donald Trump -- this is before politics -- her last week. And she had Donald Trump and my family. It was very nice. No, I like Oprah. I don't think she's going to run. I don't think she's going to run. I know her very well.\"\n\nWhat Trump knows about Oprah is that after decades of a five-days-a-week national talk show and dozens of movie and TV roles that resonated with feeling, Oprah, one of the most famous women in the world, is known for her authenticity and warmth. No one has revealed his or her heart to greater effect and, along the way, she has made emotional honesty possible for public figures.\n\nRecall Oprah talking about her trouble in childhood, her struggles in love, or even her effort to manage her weight and you are recalling the deeds of a woman who taught America how to speak from the heart. In the process, she demonstrated that her own heart is full, strong, and open in ways that Trump cannot match. The President surely understands the power of Oprah's emotional authenticity and it was this understanding that prompted his own effort to show warmth toward the DACA dreamers.\n\nThe trouble for Trump is that he has spent a lifetime showing the world that love and compassion are not his strengths. Whether he was trying to evict people from an apartment building he bought in New York or encouraging people to rough up protesters at his rally, Trump has shown that his true emotional nature is cold, not warm, cramped, not expansive.\n\nWith Oprah and her abundant love looming on the political horizon, Trump seems to have intuited that he needs to show a little kindness himself. If he wants the audience, or rather, the country, to buy his performance, he'll need to cultivate some of the real thing.",

        "body": "In order to prove he doesn\u2019t have dementia, as alleged in a recent book, President Trump called a meeting with congressional leaders on Tuesday \u2013 and requested that it be televised.\nIvanka: Show them at your best, Daddy!\nHe then proceeded to completely sell out the base and actually added to his problems by appearing senile.\nIn a half-dozen exchanges \u2013 which, again, he wanted televised \u2013 Trump responded to remarks as if he had no clue what the person was saying. One senator would talk \u2013 he\u2019d agree. Someone else would say the exact opposite \u2013 he\u2019d agree with that, too.\nActual exchange:\nSEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN: \u201cWhat about a clean DACA bill now, with a commitment that we go into a comprehensive immigration reform procedure? \u2026\u201d\nTRUMP: \u201c\u2026 I have no problem. \u2026 We\u2019re going to come up with DACA. We\u2019re going to do DACA, and then we can start immediately on the phase two, which would be comprehensive.\u201d\nSEN. FEINSTEIN: \u201cWould you be agreeable to that?\u201d\nTRUMP: \u201cI think a lot of people would like to see that, but I think we have to do DACA first.\u201d\nREP. KEVIN MCCARTHY: \u201cMr. President, you need to be clear, though. I think what Sen. Feinstein is asking here: When we talk about just DACA, we don\u2019t want to be back here two years later. You have to have security, as the secretary would tell you.\u201d\nTRUMP: \u201cBut I think that\u2019s what she\u2019s saying.\u201d\nREP. MCCARTHY: \u201cNo, no, I think she\u2019s saying something different. \u2026\u201d\nTRUMP: \u201cI do believe that. Because once we get DACA done \u2013 if it\u2019s done properly \u2013 with, you know, security and everything else \u2026\u201d\nTrump was more than willing to sell out the base to solve a personal problem of his \u2013 the Michael Wolff book \u2013 but managed not to convince a single American that he\u2019s articulate, bright or a good leader.\nOn MSNBC, the hosts didn\u2019t say, \u201cYou know, we saw a new side of Trump today \u2026\u201d Instead, they could barely suppress their giggles over the great negotiator being rolled.\nThe Democrats\u2019 opening bid is: Not only does every poor person in the world get to come live here, but all their relatives get to come, too!\nThey don\u2019t control any branch of government, and they\u2019re not budging from that.\nTrump\u2019s counter-offer is: OK! My immigration policy is whatever you send me!\nThe end result was: On the left, they\u2019re happy, but still think Trump\u2019s a moron. On the right, they\u2019re unhappy, and also think Trump\u2019s a moron.\nThe people who do not realize Tuesday was the lowest moment of the Trump presidency have no idea what they\u2019re talking about. The headline on Trump\u2019s sit-down could have been:\n\u201cTRUMP ANNOUNCES SAME FAILED AMNESTY DEAL WE HAD 30 YEARS AGO\u201d\nThe media have done such a fantastic job lying to the public that no one knows that.\nTo the average viewer, it sounds like a totally fair deal. We give only the BEST illegals a \u201cpathway\u201d to citizenship, they\u2019ll have to jump through all sorts of hoops, and in return, we\u2019ll get REAL security.\nThat\u2019s exactly what we were promised the last time. What we got: No hoops, no security, and everyone got amnesty.\nYou don\u2019t need chain migration for the alleged 800,000 \u201cDreamers\u201d to swell to 60 million \u2013 or 100 or 200 million. First, there are already at least 50 million illegals (aka Dreamers) living here. (For more, see \u201cAdios, America,\u201d pp. 72-74.)\nSecond, ANY amnesty means there will be lawsuits, whereupon the courts will grant amnesty to everyone. All of Latin America, including Latin Americans still living in Latin America, can mosey up sometime in the next 20 years, present themselves to a 9th Circuit judge and claim they were brought here as children.\nHOW CAN PEOPLE BROUGHT HERE AS CHILDREN BE EXPECTED TO PROVE IT?\nApplication approved! \nHow do I know this? Because that\u2019s how the 1986 amnesty worked.\nThe 9th Circuit was still approving applications under the 1986 amnesty in 2007 \u2013 i.e., 20 years later \u2013 from applicants who claimed it wasn\u2019t fair that they weren\u2019t in the country at the time to apply for amnesty.\nThe 1986 law was also loaded with all sorts of requirements on the illegals. We\u2019d be getting only the best! As Trump said on Tuesday, \u201cIt\u2019s an incentive for people to do a good job, if you want to know the truth. That whole path is an incentive for people.\u201d\nResult of requirements placed on illegals in the 1986 amnesty:\nEnglish-language requirement \u2013 dropped by the INS.\nFines \u2013 dropped by the INS.\nFees \u2013 waived by the INS.\nBack taxes \u2013 dropped by the IRS.\nCongress could pass a law giving amnesty ONLY to left-handed Ph.D.\u2019s in nuclear physics, and everyone would get amnesty. Even illegals who haven\u2019t arrived yet.\nIf there is a silver lining, it\u2019s that this isn\u2019t the first time Trump has sold out the base. He did it in the March 2016 GOP debate; in his \u201cHannity\u201d interview in August 2016; in the meeting with tech leaders at Trump Tower in December 2016; and in his meeting with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer last year.\nBut it\u2019s now nearly Trump\u2019s second year in office, we don\u2019t have a wall, and he just called a meeting to say, over and over again: \u201cWe have to do DACA first.\u201d\nAt this point, any sentient person has to see that the most plausible scenario is:\nLucy\u2019s gonna move the football \u2026\nLucy\u2019s gonna move the football \u2026\nLucy\u2019s gonna move the football \u2026\nLucy\u2019s gonna move the football \u2026\nLucy\u2019s gonna move the football \u2026\nLucy\u2019s gonna move the football \u2026\nShe moved the football.",

With some positive results even though comparative inaction from our government in the U.S., not seen spending money that Congress said should be spent to counter the disinformation. If you have seen coverage, pull quote is that no president ever before has ignored a national security threat like this one. But think, having read the report, it\u2019s worth noting that not only is our president not leading us to do the kinds of things other countries have been trying to do to put out the fire, in some ways our government has been pouring on gasoline and helping this thing burn.\n\nIt\u2019s long been known that Russia was working tirelessly to help Donald Trump defeat Hillary Clinton during the 2016 campaign. The president still likes to cast doubt on that reality, but it\u2019s widely accepted by the U.S. intelligence community, and any casual observer with a semi-functioning brain.\n\nOver the past year, though, it\u2019s become increasingly clear why Moscow was so adamant\u00a0to have Trump in the White House: Because he is exactly the kind of Putin puppet that Clinton repeatedly warned voters he would be. The president\u2019s repeated efforts to appease and ignore Russia, despite their constant aggression, are just further confirmation of that reality.\n\nAs Rachel Maddow said on Wednesday, Donald Trump hasn\u2019t just let Russia get away with an attack on U.S.\u00a0democracy \u2013 he\u2019s essentially\u00a0encouraging the next attack, too.",

        "body": "In order to prove he doesn\u2019t have dementia, as alleged in a recent book, President Trump called a meeting with congressional leaders on Tuesday \u2014 and requested that it be televised.\nIvanka:\u00a0Show them at your best, Daddy!\nHe then proceeded to completely sell out the base and actually added to his problems by appearing senile.\nIn a half-dozen exchanges \u2014 which, again,\u00a0he\u00a0wanted televised \u2014 Trump responded to remarks as if he had no clue what the person was saying. One senator would talk \u2014 he\u2019d agree. Someone else would say the exact opposite \u2014 he\u2019d agree with that, too.\n\n\n\n\nActual exchange:\nSEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN: \u201cWhat about a clean DACA bill now, with a commitment that we go into a comprehensive immigration reform procedure? \u2026\u201d\nTRUMP: \u201c\u2026 I have no problem. \u2026 We\u2019re going to come up with DACA. We\u2019re going to do DACA, and then we can start immediately on the phase two, which would be comprehensive.\u201d\nSEN. FEINSTEIN: \u201cWould you be agreeable to that?\u201d\n\n\n\nTRUMP: \u201cI think a lot of people would like to see that, but I think we have to do DACA first.\u201d\nREP. KEVIN MCCARTHY: \u201cMr. President, you need to be clear though. I think what Sen. Feinstein is asking here: When we talk about just DACA, we don\u2019t want to be back here two years later. You have to have security, as the secretary would tell you.\u201d\nTRUMP: \u201cBut I think that\u2019s what she\u2019s saying.\u201d\nREP. MCCARTHY: \u201cNo, no, I think she\u2019s saying something different. \u2026\u201d\nTRUMP: \u201cI do believe that. Because once we get DACA done \u2014 if it\u2019s done properly \u2014 with, you know, security and everything else \u2026\u201d\nTrump was more than willing to sell out the base to solve a personal problem of his \u2014 the Michael Wolff book \u2014 but managed to not convince a single American that he\u2019s articulate, bright or a good leader.\nOn MSNBC, the hosts didn\u2019t say, \u201cYou know, we saw a new side of Trump today \u2026\u201d Instead, they could barely suppress their giggles over the great negotiator being rolled.\nThe Democrats\u2019 opening bid is:\u00a0Not only does every poor person in the world get to come live here, but all their relatives get to come, too!\nThey don\u2019t control any branch of government, and they\u2019re not budging from that.\nTrump\u2019s counter-offer is:\u00a0OK! My immigration policy is whatever you send me!\nThe end result was: On the left, they\u2019re happy, but still think Trump\u2019s a moron. On the right, they\u2019re unhappy, and also think Trump\u2019s a moron.\nThe people who do not realize Tuesday was the lowest moment of the Trump presidency have no idea what they\u2019re talking about. The headline on Trump\u2019s sit-down could have been:\n\u201cTRUMP ANNOUNCES SAME FAILED AMNESTY DEAL WE HAD 30 YEARS AGO\u201d\nThe media have done such a fantastic job lying to the public that no one knows that.\nTo the average viewer, it sounds like a totally fair deal. We give only the BEST illegals a \u201cpathway\u201d to citizenship, they\u2019ll have to jump through all sorts of hoops, and in return, we\u2019ll get REAL security.\nThat\u2019s exactly what we were promised the last time. What we got: No hoops, no security and everyone got amnesty.\nYou don\u2019t need chain migration for the alleged 800,000 \u201cDreamers\u201d to swell to 60 million \u2014 or 100 or 200 million. First, there are already at least 50 million illegals (aka Dreamers) living here. (For more, see\u00a0Adios, America\u00a0pp 72-74.)\nSecond, ANY amnesty means there will be lawsuits, whereupon the courts will grant amnesty to everyone. All of Latin America, including Latin Americans still living in Latin America, can mosey up sometime in the next 20 years, present themselves to a Ninth Circuit judge and claim they were brought here as children.\nHOW CAN PEOPLE BROUGHT HERE AS CHILDREN BE EXPECTED TO PROVE IT?\nApplication approved!\nHow do I know this? Because that\u2019s how the 1986 amnesty worked.\nThe Ninth Circuit was still approving applications under the 1986 amnesty\u00a0in 2007\u00a0\u2014 i.e., 20 years later \u2014 from applicants who claimed it wasn\u2019t fair that they weren\u2019t in the country at the time to apply for amnesty.\nThe 1986 law was also loaded with all sorts of requirements on the illegals. We\u2019d be getting only the best! As Trump said on Tuesday, \u201cIt\u2019s an incentive for people to do a good job, if you want to know the truth. That whole path is an incentive for people.\u201d\nResult of requirements placed on illegals in the 1986 amnesty:\nEnglish-language requirement \u2014 dropped by the INS.\nFines \u2014 dropped by the INS.\nFees \u2014 waived by the INS.\nBack taxes \u2014 dropped by the IRS.\nCongress could pass a law giving amnesty ONLY to left-handed Ph.D.\u2019s in nuclear physics, and everyone would get amnesty. Even illegals who haven\u2019t arrived yet.\nIf there is a silver lining, it\u2019s that this isn\u2019t the first time Trump has sold out the base. He did it in the March 2016 GOP debate; in his \u201cHannity\u201d interview in August 2016; in the meeting with tech leaders at Trump Tower in December 2016; and in his meeting with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer last year.\nBut it\u2019s now Trump\u2019s second year in office, we don\u2019t have a wall, and he just called a meeting to say, over and over again: \u201cWe have to do DACA first.\u201d\nAt this point, any sentient person has to see that the most plausible scenario is:\nLucy\u2019s gonna move the football \u2026\nLucy\u2019s gonna move the football \u2026\nLucy\u2019s gonna move the football \u2026\nLucy\u2019s gonna move the football \u2026\nLucy\u2019s gonna move the football \u2026\nLucy\u2019s gonna move the football \u2026\nShe moved the football.\nAnn Coulter is a syndicated columnist and lawyer.\n\nThe\u00a0views and opinions\u00a0expressed in this commentary are those of the author and do\u00a0not\u00a0reflect the official position of The Daily Caller.",

        "title": "Presidential Physicals Should Include the Brain",
        "body": "Right now, the technology exists to detect the very early stages of Alzheimer\u2019s disease -- as well as to flag abnormal protein deposits that can grow in peoples\u2019 brains long before symptoms of dementia become apparent.No tests of this sort will apparently be featured in Donald Trump\u2019s Jan. 12 physical, according to those in the know, but some brain experts and medical ethicists argue they should be. Such early evaluations might one day become important for ordinary citizens, if drugs now in the pipeline prove effective in forestalling dementia symptoms. In the meantime, it behooves us all to have more information when the brain in question belongs to someone with access to classified information and nuclear codes.The state of the current presidential brain has generated intense interest, from the gossip in journalist Michael Wolff\u2019s new book to the concerns aired in the medical website STAT News -- including an opinion piece titled I\u2019m a Brain Specialist. I Think Trump Should Be Tested for a Degenerative Brain Disease.\n        \n        \n        \n        Experts say an evaluation would start with simple written and oral tasks: naming items in pictures, recalling strings of letters and numbers, calling up lists of words, and the like. If those tests signal trouble, doctors might move on to a brain scan to look for protein deposits called beta amyloid.The role of beta amyloid was controversial for years, since some perfectly sharp people die and reveal brains full of this abnormal protein. Harvard neurology professor Rudoph Tanzi has led experiments in cultured human brain cells pointing to amyloid as a first step in the progression of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Amyloids can trigger growth of another abnormal protein deposit called neurofibrillary tangles,\u00a0he said, and that situation can trigger excess inflammation, the death of brain cells, and full-blown dementia.Right now, he said, it is possible to use brain imaging to see which healthy people have a lot of beta amyloid and are therefore at elevated risk. Already several drugs have been shown to reduce amyloid plaques -- and he\u2019s gearing up to start clinical trials of another. No drugs have restored memory or thinking ability in advanced-stage patients, but Tanzi and others have high hopes for prevention by giving the drugs much earlier.Tanzi noted that an open letter has been circulating among the medical community urging experts to demand Trump get a neuropsychological evaluation.\u00a0He has not added his name, he said, because he worries the letter might be misinterpreted as a statement that Trump has dementia in the eyes of the experts. He doesn\u2019t think Trump should be diagnosed through his television appearances, but he does agree with those who argue that all presidents should be given a genuine, science-based evaluation.He says if such evaluations started taking place, the results wouldn\u2019t be black or white. It\u2019s typical for people to search for words or forget names more often in their 60s than in their 20s he said, just as older people develop problems with their knees or shoulders. At the same time, people gain wisdom with age and experience. A test result showing some risk of dementia and memory decline should be weighed\u00a0alongside\u00a0other factors.\n        \n        Not all forms of dementia primarily affect memory. A disease called frontotemporal dementia (FTD) attacks the frontal lobe, which is the seat of judgment and impulse control. While FTD is less common than Alzheimer\u2019s disease, it tends to hit people earlier in life -- usually starting in their 50s or 60s. Neurology professor Murray Grossman, who directs the center for FTD at the University of Pennsylvania, said that the disease is characterized by a different mix of abnormal protein deposits than Alzheimer\u2019s, and these can be picked up in a test of spinal fluid. Some cases are characterized by extremely rigid or apathetic behavior. In other cases, people become uninhibited and prone to making inappropriate comments or gestures.People with FTD often have very little insight into their own condition, said Grossman. They may think everything is fine, while those around them grow alarmed about their changing behavior. Some patients with this disease also develop progressive aphasia -- the loss of language.Of course, other incapacitating conditions could impair a leader\u2019s ability to function, and yet this presidential check-up may be less informative than some would hope. Family physician Ranit Mishori, of Georgetown University School of Medicine, warned not to confuse the number of tests done with the value of the information gathered. VIP or executive physicals, she said, often take more time and incorporate more tests than standard check-ups, but they don\u2019t necessarily yield more information. That's because not all the tests are equally evidence-based.In a conversation I had several months ago with NYU medical ethicist Arthur Caplan, he said he disapproved of speculation\u00a0about Trump\u2019s mental and cognitive health. In a recent piece for Forbes.com, written with University of Pennsylvania ethicist Jonathan Moreno, he urges Congress to impose a mandatory exam that would assess factors that affect a president\u2019s ability to do the job. It would be a physical designed not for the president\u2019s benefit, but for ours. This seems like as good a time to start such a policy as any.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.To contact the author of this story:                Faye Flam     at fflam1@bloomberg.netTo contact the editor responsible for this story:                Tracy Walsh     at twalsh67@bloomberg.net",

        "body": "On August 5, 2017, I wrote about the need for a Diaspora Policy for Trinidad and Tobago. With the impending arrival of hundreds of overseas nationals for Carnival it is as good a time as any to revisit what ought to be an imperative for our national development.\n\nAs much as we need to highlight the achievements of selected individuals we should also look at the broad mass of people who have migrated and acquired a range of skills abroad.\n\nAccording to the World Economic Forum 22 per cent of the local population, amounting to 360,000 people, live outside of T&T.\n\nIn my March letter to the editor I referenced comments from Dr Michele Reis, author of The Who\u2019s Who in the Trinidad and Tobago Diaspora.\n\nShe said one avenue in alleviating developmental problems lies in harnessing the skills of the Diaspora. Furthermore, her analysis was that this had not been achieved in T&T because successive governments and the constituent community in the homeland, have failed to recognise the overseas population as an integral part of the nation.\n\nIn two Caricom countries, Jamaica and Guyana, the Prime Ministers and Foreign Ministers have embraced a Diaspora Policy.\n\nJamaica\u2019s Prime Minister, Mr Andrew Holness, on April 4 last year, launched the seventh biennial Jamaica Diaspora Conference which was organised by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade.\n\nIn July Guyana\u2019s President David Granger delivered the keynote address to declare the opening of the First University of Guyana Diaspora Engagement\u00a0Conference.\n\nGuyana established a ministerial sub-committee comprising foreign affairs, public security, state, finance, business and citizenship to finalise the Government\u2019s Diaspora Engagement Strategy and Action Plan.\n\nWithin any Diaspora Policy T&T must address our brain drain. The problem is not unknown to opinion leaders of this country because there was commentary about the departure of skilled (and unskilled people) between Independence in 1962 and before the Trinidad and Tobago Revolution of 1970.\n\nChalkdust (Dr Hollis Liverpool), put his own spin on the loss of our human resource. In 1968 he sang:\n\nJust because some teachers move away. To improve their status and their pay. Plenty people calling this Brain Drain. But I say they should be shame.\n\nThey ain\u2019t see Horace James and Errol John. Teaching drama to foreign sons. They would never see our best footballers. In the States as professionals.\n\nAh hope you see look sailors and police went to Expo. And only one true calypsonian go. And when foreign artiste come. They does get lump sum.\n\nAnd calypsonians must sing for rum. And when steel bandsmen teach them outsiders. To tune a pan for kisses and favours. That is what I call Brain Drain.\n\nDuring the 1971 Budget presentation Mr Francis Prevatt, Minister of Finance, Planning and Development, spoke about migration. Significantly his statement was made one day prior to NJAC\u2019s Rededication Day demonstration, the first after the State of Emergency.\n\nPrevatt revealed, \u201cbetween 1962 and 1968 there were 17,200 emigrants from this country, among whom were 11,500 professional or technically qualified people. Included in this number were 143 doctors, 170 engineers, 679 nurses, 784 teachers, 909 other professionals and over 8,200 technicians and craftsmen\u201d.\n\nHe added, \u201cThe brain drain presents this country with an extremely intractable dilemma, one which can only be solved by appropriate motivation and by negotiations with the principal countries receiving our emigrants\u201d.\n\nResearch has revealed that from 1962 to 1968, a total of 70 per cent of T&T\u2019s university graduates migrated from this country or just stayed overseas after their studies.\n\nThe point is that too much time has elapsed since we were made aware of the need for a Diaspora Policy as well as the gravity of the Brain Drain. All interest groups, the Government, the Diaspora itself and private citizens here in T&T have a responsibility to address these related issues.",

        "body": "OF MICE AND MEN\nDonald Trump as Frank Sinatra, Kellyanne Conway as Angie Dickinson, Steve Bannon as Dean Martin, Jared Kushner as Peter Lawford, and Reince Priebus as Joey Bishop.Illustration by Barry Blitt.As staff nervously eye the exits, the White House has reportedly offered an ultimatum: either leave before the end of January or stay put until the November midterm elections, CNN reports. The deadline is intended to balance an ongoing reshuffle with the threat of a larger exodus\u2014a chaotic combination made worse by the Trump administration\u2019s struggle to find qualified candidates. It\u2019s also a charge the White House vigorously denies. \u201cThere has been no directive on staff departures and any suggestion otherwise is ridiculous fake news,\u201d said Sarah Huckabee Sanders.Despite these protestations, there are inarguably some gaping holes in Donald Trump\u2019s team. The role of chief strategist, once occupied by Steve Bannon, is conspicuously vacant. As is the senior aide position held by Keith Schiller, the former security chief who moved to the White House as an aide-de-camp and left in September. The embattled Office of Political Affairs remains in a state of transition: While current head Bill Stepien is set to remain in place (for how long is unclear), he will now be overseen by Johnny DeStafano, pulling triple duty at the Office of Presidential Personnel and the Office of Public Liaison and the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs. Although the promotion speaks to his competence, it also suggests that Chief of Staff John Kelly, who has vowed to fill the ranks by the end of January, is struggling to find anyone else to take on the roles.There are multiple reasons for the lack of enthusiastic and suitably qualified candidates. The first is ideological. The extremity of Trump\u2019s stances have alienated many Republicans, who fear working in the White House might tarnish the trajectory of their careers. Trump, in turn, is not keen to hire anyone who might prove even somewhat disloyal. \u201cThere are still a lot of people who have said they are unwilling to work in the White House and there are a lot of people the White House are unwilling to have come in,\u201d Republican operative Doug Heye told CNN.The more obvious problem is turnover: Dina Powell and Jeremy Katz are exeunt stage left, with Gary Cohn expected soon thereafter. While Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump apparently plan to remain in Washington at least through the 2018 school year, few believe they will stay long. More notable casualties include Sean Spicer, infamous purveyor of \u201calternative facts\u201d; Michael Flynn, who was ostensibly fired for lying to Vice President Mike Pence and recently pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I.; Sebastien Gorka, whose association with extremist politics in Hungary have not diminished his star at Fox News; and, of course, the silver-tongued Anthony Scaramucci.The Brookings Institution concludes that the Trump administration has seen more exits than any first year president in the last four decades, with 34 percent of Trump\u2019s senior staff departing in the past year alone.The larger issue isn\u2019t necessarily Trump\u2019s tendency to shed staff, but his difficulty attracting new talent. It is no secret that nearly everyone who has worked for Trump in a public-facing role has, at some point, been subject to humiliation, either in their interactions with the press\u2014\u00e0 la Spicer\u2014or at the hands of their boss, as Attorney General Jeff Sessions can affirm. And then there is the specter of Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia probe, which has already led to four indictments, and is now circling closer to Trump. As one person familiar with the White House\u2019s staffing challenges told CNN, candidates that might otherwise fill some West Wing vacancies don\u2019t see working for Trump as a prestigious career move. They see it as a potential \u201cticket to the grand jury.\u201d",

        "body": "The Trump administration\u2019s National Security Strategy starts by declaring that it will use \u201cprincipled realism\u201d to put American interests, values and prosperity first. It says that engagement with the world needn\u2019t mean abandoning national self-interest, that great power competition should be the main preoccupation of U.S. security, and that allies should do more to provide for their own defense. Such realist rhetoric offends most foreign-policy pundits in Washington, who tend to deny that U.S. interests and global goods are distinguishable.\nThe critics have it backwards. The strategy isn\u2019t too realist or too narrowly focused on American interests. Its problem lies in its shortcomings in properly applying those principles. Rather than chart an overdue departure from the overwrought approach to security that this administration inherited, the strategy endorses it with vaguely realist rhetoric. It proposes too little meaningful change aside from a few protectionist measures, which would harm our economic prosperity even though the strategy claims that as its lodestar.\n\n\nThis lack of prioritization mirrors U.S. security policy. Formal strategy statements like this one are supposed to guide security policy, but mostly they promote it. As U.S. foreign policy has grown more ambitious, especially since the Cold War ended, strategy statements have become less focused. They avoid the fundamental purpose of strategy, which is to prioritize, guiding the allocation of limited resources to most efficiently protect our national interests. Instead they indulge in flights of rhetorical fancy about the virtues of U.S. power, imagining that peace, liberalism and stability everywhere depend on our self-appointed role as global sheriff.\nThe Obama administration\u2019s last National Security Strategy, for instance, lists eight \u201ctop-strategic risks,\u201d including \u201cdisease, economic slowdown, and climate change.\u201d It mentions \u201chard choices\u201d and warns against \u201coverreach\u201d but declares that \u201cthere are no global problems that cannot be solved without the United States.\u201d\nDefining security so capaciously exaggerates danger, making our strong geopolitical position seem precarious when it is the envy of every other country. The document\u2019s lack of prioritization demands excessive Pentagon spending and calls for missions that needlessly overburden the military. Its preoccupation with peripheral concerns comes at the expense of core U.S. interests: defending Americans, enhancing our prosperity, and protecting our way of life.\nWith its stated focus on those goals and its relatively direct language, the Trump strategy initially seems poised to avoid these pitfalls. But upon close inspection, mostly it doesn\u2019t, and it adds a few of its own. Let\u2019s take its good ideas, its bad execution and its ugly new problems in turn.\nThe Good\nIn addition to its promising start, the document deserves praise for focusing on U.S. values and prosperity. These goods are too easily sacrificed when dangers are invoked. The strategy correctly calls the $20 trillion and counting in national debt \u201ca grave threat to America\u2019s long-term prosperity and, by extension, our national security.\u201d That\u2019s a useful reminder as spending hikes threaten to send the debt even higher.\nThe new strategy\u2019s conclusion also contains a noteworthy paragraph:\nThis strategy is guided by principled realism. It is realist because it acknowledges the central role of power in international politics, affirms that sovereign states are the best hope for a peaceful world, and clearly defines America\u2019s national interests. It is principled because it is grounded in the knowledge that advancing American principles spreads peace and prosperity around the globe. We are guided by our values and disciplined by our interests.Pages",

        "body": "In order to prove he doesn\u2019t have dementia, as alleged in a recent book, President Trump called a meeting with congressional leaders on Tuesday\u2014and requested that it be televised.\n\nIvanka: Show them at your best, Daddy!\n\nHe then proceeded to completely sell out the base and actually added to his problems by appearing senile.\n\nIn a half-dozen exchanges\u2014which, again, he wanted televised\u2014Trump responded to remarks as if he had no clue what the person was saying. One senator would talk\u2014he\u2019d agree. Someone else would say the exact opposite\u2014he\u2019d agree with that, too.\n\nSEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN: \u201cWhat about a clean DACA bill now, with a commitment that we go into a comprehensive immigration reform procedure? \u2026\u201d TRUMP: \u201c\u2026 I have no problem. \u2026 We\u2019re going to come up with DACA. We\u2019re going to do DACA, and then we can start immediately on the phase two, which would be comprehensive.\u201d SEN. FEINSTEIN: \u201cWould you be agreeable to that?\u201d TRUMP: \u201cI think a lot of people would like to see that, but I think we have to do DACA first.\u201d REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY: \u201cMr. President, you need to be clear though. I think what Sen. Feinstein is asking here: When we talk about just DACA, we don\u2019t want to be back here two years later. You have to have security, as the secretary would tell you.\u201d REP. MCCARTHY: \u201cNo, no, I think she\u2019s saying something different. \u2026\u201d TRUMP: \u201cI do believe that. Because once we get DACA done\u2014if it\u2019s done properly\u2014with, you know, security and everything else \u2026\u201d\n\nTrump was more than willing to sell out the base to solve a personal problem of his\u2014the Michael Wolff book\u2014but managed to not convince a single American that he\u2019s articulate, bright or a good leader.\n\nOn MSNBC, the hosts didn\u2019t say, \u201cYou know, we saw a new side of Trump today \u2026\u201d Instead, they could barely suppress their giggles over the great negotiator being rolled.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 opening bid is: Not only does every poor person in the world get to come live here, but all their relatives get to come, too!\n\nThey don\u2019t control any branch of government, and they\u2019re not budging from that.\n\nTrump\u2019s counter-offer is: OK! My immigration policy is whatever you send me!\n\nThe end result was: On the left, they\u2019re happy, but still think Trump\u2019s a moron. On the right, they\u2019re unhappy, and also think Trump\u2019s a moron.\n\nThe people who do not realize Tuesday was the lowest moment of the Trump presidency have no idea what they\u2019re talking about. The headline on Trump\u2019s sit-down could have been:\n\n\u201cTRUMP ANNOUNCES SAME FAILED AMNESTY DEAL WE HAD 30 YEARS AGO\u201d\n\nThe media have done such a fantastic job lying to the public that no one knows that.\n\nTo the average viewer, it sounds like a totally fair deal. We give only the BEST illegals a \u201cpathway\u201d to citizenship, they\u2019ll have to jump through all sorts of hoops, and in return, we\u2019ll get REAL security.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what we were promised the last time. What we got: No hoops, no security and everyone got amnesty.\n\nYou don\u2019t need chain migration for the alleged 800,000 \u201cDreamers\u201d to swell to 60 million\u2014or 100 or 200 million. First, there are already at least 50 million illegals (aka Dreamers) living here. (For more, see Adios, America pp 72-74.)\n\nSecond, ANY amnesty means there will be lawsuits, whereupon the courts will grant amnesty to everyone. All of Latin America, including Latin Americans still living in Latin America, can mosey up sometime in the next 20 years, present themselves to a Ninth Circuit judge and claim they were brought here as children.\n\nHOW CAN PEOPLE BROUGHT HERE AS CHILDREN BE EXPECTED TO PROVE IT?\n\nHow do I know this? Because that\u2019s how the 1986 amnesty worked.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit was still approving applications under the 1986 amnesty in 2007\u2014i.e., 20 years later\u2014from applicants who claimed it wasn\u2019t fair that they weren\u2019t in the country at the time to apply for amnesty.\n\nThe 1986 law was also loaded with all sorts of requirements on the illegals. We\u2019d be getting only the best! As Trump said on Tuesday, \u201cIt\u2019s an incentive for people to do a good job, if you want to know the truth. That whole path is an incentive for people.\u201d\n\nResult of requirements placed on illegals in the 1986 amnesty:\n\nCongress could pass a law giving amnesty ONLY to left-handed Ph.D.\u2019s in nuclear physics, and everyone would get amnesty. Even illegals who haven\u2019t arrived yet.\n\nIf there is a silver lining, it\u2019s that this isn\u2019t the first time Trump has sold out the base. He did it in the March 2016 GOP debate; in his \u201cHannity\u201d interview in August 2016; in the meeting with tech leaders at Trump Tower in December 2016; and in his meeting with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer last year.\n\nBut it\u2019s now Trump\u2019s second year in office, we don\u2019t have a wall, and he just called a meeting to say, over and over again: \u201cWe have to do DACA first.\u201d\n\nAt this point, any sentient person has to see that the most plausible scenario is:",

I think that's when somebody\u2019s ideology overtakes their brain you have a problem because ideologies, I think, are dominating that poll,\" Bartiromo, who joined Fox Business from CNBC in 2014, said during an interview on Fox News.\n\nBartiromo was commenting on a Quinnipiac University poll released\u00a0Wednesday\u00a0showing that 49 percent of respondents\u00a0say\u00a0they think that improving economic conditions are because of Obama, with just 40 percent crediting Trump.\n\n\"There is no doubt that the expansion bottomed out under President Obama, there\u2019s no doubt,\"\u00a0Bartiromo asserted Thursday.\u00a0\"The stock market and the economic recovery began under President Obama, no doubt about it, it was in 2009 was the bottom of the market when we first started seeing a change in terms of economic growth.\"\n\n\"But we have been growing in the last 10 years by on average 2 percent under President Obama. His best year was the worst year for most presidents. So, once President Trump started campaigning on these policies about lowering taxes, about rolling back regulations, there was an anticipation that started to creep up and that started to force businesses to unleash the purse strings. There is a reason that businesses were sitting on so much cash under the Obama Administration, and that is because they were getting strangled by regulation,\" she continued.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"President Trump comes in, he rolls back all of these regulations and almost instantaneously businesses said, \u2018OK, we\u2019re not going to be shackled anymore and we\u2019ll start looking for opportunities to put that money to work whether it\u2019s hiring people or investing in their business.\u2019 There is no doubt about it.\u201d\n\nQuinnipiac has asked the same poll question in other months. The percentage of those crediting Trump for the nation's economy rose steadily through most of the year, topping 43 percent in December before ticking back down to 40 percent this month.\n\nThe January poll also finds that 66 percent of U.S. voters say the economy is \u201cexcellent\u201d or \u201cgood,\u201d the most positive rating for the economy in the poll since 2001.",

And so must the rhetorical conflation of Trump and Bannon. Trump must be seen as his own man and judged by his own words.\n... with Bannon clearly out of Trump\u2019s inner circle, there can be no whispers of a power structure outside the White House. Like Ronald Reagan, Trump keeps his own counsel. There is no Valerie Jarrett or Karl Rove. It\u2019s just the president and his agenda.\n\nSo there isn't an adviser who can be called \"Trump's brain\"? I guess that's true -- there isn't an adviser who fills that role.\nThere are three:\n\nJonathan Chait explains:\nDuring his morning Executive Time, President Trump took a well-deserved break from his long hours of document study to watch Fox News. The segment featured one of the talking heads urging Trump to oppose the House bill reauthorizing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). The president immediately tweeted out his alarmed confusion that the House was apparently on the verge of approving the very law the sinister Deep State had used to \u201ctapp\u201d his phones:\n\n\u201cHouse votes on controversial FISA ACT today.\u201d This is the act that may have been used, with the help of the discredited and phony Dossier, to so badly surveil and abuse the Trump Campaign by the previous administration and others?\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 11, 2018\n\n... The president\u2019s alarm was unfortunate, since the Trump administration strongly supports reauthorization of this law. It has sent its highest-ranking security officials to lobbyCongress for reauthorization, and reiterated its endorsement of the law as recently as last night.\n\n\u2193 Story continues below \u2193So I guess there can be \"whispers of a power structure outside the White House\" after all -- or not whispers exactly, because anyone can see exactly where that power structure is by turning on the TV in the morning.\nAnd as for Trump \"keep[ing] his own counsel,\" consider what happened next:\nApparently somebody has explained the administration\u2019s position to the president, who has followed up his old tweet opposing the House bill with a new one supporting it:\n\nWith that being said, I have personally directed the fix to the unmasking process since taking office and today\u2019s vote is about foreign surveillance of foreign bad guys on foreign land. We need it! Get smart!\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 11, 2018\n\nSo first Trump proclaimed his enthusiastic agreement with a guest on his favorite TV show, then he expressed agreement with a staffer who'd gently explained to him that the guest on his favorite TV show was wrong. In each case, he declared himself in agreement with the last person who'd talked to him. Yeah, that's what keeping one's own counsel looks like, isn't it?\nOriginally published at No More Mr. Nice Blog",

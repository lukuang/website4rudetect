1	NONE	First lady Melania Trump arrived in McAllen, Texas, on Thursday to visit a detention center for undocumented immigrant children. She initiated the visit on Tuesday — one day before President Donald Trump signed an executive order to top separating undocumented immigrant parents and their children and instead detain them together — her chief of staff, Stephanie Grisham, told reporters, “I’m here to learn about your facility, in which I know you house children on a long-term basis,” Melania Trump said at the Upbring New Hope Children’s Shelter. Speaking to reporters, Grisham echoed those sentiments but emphasized that the first lady believes all immigration to the U.S. should be done legally. Reporters covering the controversial administration policy of separating unauthorized immigrant children from their parents said the visit did not give her an accurate look at the crisis 2,000 immigrant children have been separated from their parents in recent weeks under the new zero tolerance border policy. The centers confiscated any toys and other possessions the children arrived with, and according to American Academy of Pediatrics President Colleen Kraft, adults at the facilities are not allowed to comfort or touch the children.

2	NONE	"When the crisis of family separations erupted at the border, Republican leaders revised the bill to bolster a provision requiring parents and children to be held together in custody. The request comes a day after President Donald Trump signed an order stopping the practice that has resulted in the separation of more than 2,300 children from their families. ""Mrs. Trump hates to see children separated from their families and hopes both sides of the aisle can finally come together to achieve successful immigration reform"", Grisham said in a statement. There is ""no way"" the ""catch and release"" of deportable immigrants can stop under President Donald Trump's executive order to keep undocumented immigrant parents and children together, said Brandon Judd, president of the National Border Patrol Council. But King believes President Trump's executive order on Wednesday took much of the heat off of Republicans, even though the order allows the administration to continue separating families and does nothing to reunite the thousands already separated."

5	NONE	"First lady Melania Trump made a visit Thursday to a Texas facility housing children who have been separated from their parents, as President Donald Trump's administration backtracks on its enforcement policy for families crossing the border illegally. The visit, which was not announced ahead of time, is another sign that members of Trump's own family have been uncomfortable with the policy of removing children from their families. Trump reversed the policy Wednesday, but the next steps are not clear yet for children like those Melania Trump saw Thursday. Melania Trump's communications director, Stephanie Grisham, told reporters traveling with her that the first lady had asked Tuesday that the trip be organized, one day before the president issued an executive order changing his policy.

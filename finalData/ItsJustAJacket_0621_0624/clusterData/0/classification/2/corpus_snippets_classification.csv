10	NONE	President Donald Trump took heavy criticism from both sides of the aisle, former presidents and his own wife about the 'zero tolerance' immigration policy that resulted in migrant children being separated from their families at the border. Her spokesperson said the First Lady will continue to be a vocal presence on the issue as administration officials try to work out ways to reunited children and their families after President Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday. Melania Trump's visit comes after President Donald Trump credited her and daughter Ivanka for helping change his mind about separating children from their families. President Trump, when he signed his executive order on the issue on Wednesday, indicated that lobbying from Ivanka, who showed him pictures of the caged and kenneled children, and wife Melania had caused him to have a change in heart. Grisham said in a statement that 'Mrs. Trump hates to see children separated from their families and hopes both sides of the aisle can finally come together to achieve successful immigration reform'.

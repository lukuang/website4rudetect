1	NONE	MEXICO CITY — The disappearance of 43 college students on the night of Sept. 26, 2014, in the southern Mexican state of Guerrero marked a turning point for President Enrique Peña Nieto. When he won the presidency in 2012, Mr. Peña Nieto was hailed as a modern reformer promising a more democratic and transparent government. But the disappearance of the students from the Ayotzinapa teachers’ college in the small city of Iguala shocked Mexico and the world, and plunged the Peña Nieto government into an ever-deepening murk of corruption and cover-ups. For most of the time since, Mr. Peña Nieto’s approval rating has been hovering around 20 percent. Mexicans will be going to the polls to elect a new president on July 1, and the candidate from Mr. Peña Nieto’s party, the P.R.I., is unlikely to win.	NONE	NONE

4	NONE	That’s the only figure the entire crypto world has to keep in mind. Break it, Bitcoin, and it’s the end of the world. Of course, the entire crypto space is *SO* six months ago. In my entire life, I have never received so many well-intended emails from friends and readers encouraging me to ditch stocks forever and hop on board the crypto train. Just look at Google Trends to see how “over” the world is with respect to crypto: Of course, I know EXACTLY how this feels:	AGAINST	NONE
5	NONE	A 66-year-old man jumped in front of a train at College station; he had his foot amputated and was also transported to the trauma unit at St. Michael’s Hospital, unconscious and with massive injuries. That man is my brother. His beautiful wife of over 30 years knew her husband was deeply depressed and dangerously suicidal, and took him to emergency on Saturday after confirming that St. Michael’s has a psychiatric ward. His wife asked for him to be admitted and her husband agreed. Instead, the hospital sent him home with a list of phone numbers and a prescription, saying there wasn’t a bed available.	FAVOR	NONE
6	NONE	Dreamworld still has no emergency training in place almost two years after a deadly tragedy claimed four lives, two senior ride operators have told an inquest. Coroner James McDougall heard the shocking revelations on the fourth day of the inquest into the tragic deaths of Kate Goodchild, Luke Dorsett, Roozi Araghi and Cindy Low when their raft flipped on the Thunder River Rapids ride in October 2016. Mr Williams, who operated the popular Thunder River Rapids ride on the day of the tragedy before the actual incident told the inquest he was aware that the rafts were capable of tipping each other up, The Australian reported. The inquest also heard that the ride's first-aid kit was not fully stocked on the day of the tragedy. The Thunder River Rapids ride operator who watched the tragedy unfold returned to the witness stand for a second consecutive day.	AGAINST	NONE
7	NONE	Why is there dew on the grass in the morning? Sometimes I still wonder about natural phenomena, such as dew on the grass and the number of stars in the skies, but every day I have many other “whys” crossing my mind. How can we watch this on the morning news, turn off the high-def television, and drive to work or the gym or anywhere and not be out on the streets pouring out our outrage that this is happening to children anywhere in our world? How can people fill up their carts with meat obtained in such a manner? Why do we condemn the homeless while people born with silver spoons in their mouths jet and yacht all over the world leaving mammoth carbon footprints and squandering resources that could provide for countless people in our communities where unhoused developmentally disabled people, mentally ill people, physically ill people, traumatized vets and others attempt to find shelter from the elements and food to eat (not to mention appropriate places for unavoidable human functions)?

8	NONE	Despite complaints from state governments, as well as from traditional retailers, past court rulings that went all the way to the Supreme Court had upheld the ability of internet retailers not to have to pay sales taxes in most of their transactions. Why e-commerce has largely escaped sales taxes until now The history of the battle between state governments and online retailers is long. Citing a case from the 1960s that had upheld a retailer's right not to have to pay sales tax when the only contact it had with a given state was mailing goods to customers located there, Quill said it shouldn't be subject to the state sales and use tax laws. According to the decision, in order for a state to impose sales or use tax requirements, a retailer must have a physical presence, such as an office, store location, warehouse, or employees, within that state. South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. involves a fact pattern similar to Quill, with the South Dakota state government seeking to enforce a state law allowing collection of sales tax on online retailers with sales of more than $100,000 or more than 200 different transactions to South Dakota online shoppers.

9	NONE	President Trump finally caved to public pressure and promised to stop separating children from parents at the border. Trump is right that he didn’t begin the practice of wrenching crying children from their parents. This fits into a long and shameful history: “My brothers and sisters were bid off first, and one by one, while my mother, paralyzed by grief, held me by the hand. My mother, half distracted with the thought of parting forever from all her children, pushed through the crowd while the bidding for me was going on, to the spot where Riley was standing. I seem to see and hear my poor weeping mother now.”	AGAINST	NONE
10	NONE	The news that John Filion is retiring as councillor for Willowdale comes as no surprise, and we recognize that it is time for him to do other things. Mel Lastman described North York as a “city with heart,” but John Filion gave it that heart. He is committed to community development and that thread runs through much of his work for us. John Filion played an important role in the way we came together over the recent tragedy on Yonge St. He will be missed. We can best thank him by making Yonge St. safer, and giving the community a main street, something that he tirelessly championed.	NONE	NONE

2	NONE	The Mavic Air takes the features of the Mavic Pro, adds in some of the features of the Spark – namely, remote-free gesture control – and shrinks them down to a package half the size of the former. But it is better, the key difference is that the Air’s camera encodes its footage at a higher bitrate – up to an impressive 100Mbits/sec, where the Mavic Pro is limited to 60Mbits/sec – and this translates to more detail-rich video, especially if you’re shooting areas of greenery or water where there are a lot of areas of similar colour. In this mode, the drone hangs in the air, rotates itself to capture a 32-megapixel, 360-degree spherical panorama and then stitches it back together for you so you can zoom in and pan around in the DJI Go app. My preferred method of flying the Mavic Air is with the newly redesigned remote control as it’s much, much easier to fly this way. Even in that standard mode, though, the Mavic Pro is brilliantly solid in the air and supremely flyable, even in moderate wind.	FAVOR	NONE

Komili has been flying planes since 1988 and a few years ago bought his first drone. Like all fledgling pilots of unmanned aerial vehicles ― or UAVs ― he relished the chance to zip around Santa Barbara airspace and capture incredible images of our quickly educated himself on drone regulations, but he also observed that many other operators, especially young ones, were unaware of the dangers and liabilities. “There are strict laws for drone flight,” he explained, “especially around places like the Santa Barbara Airport, for obvious reasons.” To clear up any confusion, and to stop short potential issues with local law enforcement, Komili created the Drone Club as a place where remote pilots, both experienced and novice, can come to learn the rules, talk shop, improve their flying skills, and develop relationships with others who use the shared airspace.

Drone photographer Johnny Miller, who has been awarded fellowships by Code For Africa (a news organisation in South Africa) and the London School of Economics (LSE), with his somewhat unique project “Unequal Scenes” has set on to portray snapshots of inequality from South Africa, the United States, and among other places, India’s maximum city, Mumbai. “One day in April 2016, I had a ‘light bulb’ moment when I decided to take a drone over one area of Cape Town I knew to be very unequal — and the project was born,” Miller said in an e-mail interview. Miller has also photographed from locations such as Mexico city and Nairobi, and the scale and the scope of slums in Mumbai was the most striking find for Miller. Using drone photography, Miller is able to capture extremely different landscapes in one frame, leaving a trail of socio-economic inequality reflected in geographical discrepancies.	FAVOR	NONE

8	NONE	The popularity of hobby drones has led to an uptick in flights in restricted areas such as airports, prisons, and even government facilities. Capturing it this way prevents the drone from crashing to the ground where vital evidence could be lost, and instead enables the DroneCatcher to bring the machine back to base in one piece. At a place like an airport where even the shortest flight disruption can cost large amounts of money, every second counts — you only have to see how a single drone incursion at London’s busy Gatwick Airport last year caused untold chaos as multiple flights had to be diverted. There are plenty of different ways for airport and prison operators to tackle unauthorized drone flights. Delft Dynamics‘ DroneCatcher isn’t the first drone we’ve seen that uses a net to capture illegally flown drones.	FAVOR	NONE

10	NONE	But a major barrier for commercial drones falls this summer, as the Federal Aviation Administration rolls out an app-connected online service that cuts the response time on flight requests from three months to just a few seconds. “Over 2,000 square miles of airspace that was previously unavailable to commercial operators is now going to be available,” says Joshua Ziering, cofounder of Kittyhawk, maker of an eponymous mobile and web-based software suite for managing drones. “It’s airspace near airports, which includes most of the major urban areas in America and some of the most valuable areas to fly a drone,” says Bill Goodwin, chief counsel and policy head for AirMap, a maker of drone mapping and planning software.

Developed by NASA with help from the FAA, UTM will parcel out airspace in narrow pathways that allow many drones and air taxis–possibly even traditional helicopters and planes–to fly close together without colliding.

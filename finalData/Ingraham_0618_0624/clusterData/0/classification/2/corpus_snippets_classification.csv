1	NONE	"That issue is front and center in a ground-breaking discussion featuring three leading women in the animal rights movement, Friends of Animals President Priscilla Feral, LAIKA magazine Editorial Director Julie Gueraseva and Rutgers University Animal Rights Law Clinic Co-Founder Anna Charlton, who sat down to explore the intersection between feminism and animal rights in a cover story published in FoA's summer Action Line. The forward-thinking roundtable conversation by the women, each of whom have spearheaded innovative animal advocacy campaigns, delves into sexist animal rights media campaigns, male-dominated hierarchical nonprofit structures and the objectification of all living beings in a movement that is supposed to focus on moral values and compassion but has been criticized for becoming a misogynistic cult. ""Animal rights theory requires feminist principles."" Charlton, who co-authored three books on animal rights and veganism, questioned campaigns by such groups as PeTA that show sexy, naked women rejecting fur, and said it's time to call out all sexist messages. Friends of Animals, an international animal protection organization founded in N.Y. in 1957 and headquartered in Darien, CT, advocates for the rights of free-living and domestic animals."	NONE	NONE

3	NONE	FLORENCE — There is always a lot of activity at the Florence-Lauderdale Animal Shelter, but for the last few days employees have been busier than usual. He said last week there were nearly 250 animals in the shelters, which is double the 125 animals the facility can handle. Holt announced last week that beginning Saturday, the shelter will not be taking in any new animals until July 5. On Wednesday, two women from Maine, Kaitlyn Hankins and Sarah McPhail, who work with Grateful Day Rescue, were at the shelter to look at animals that could be adopted out in Maine. Fox said the shelter continues to take in animals, which offsets the number of animals adopted out.	NONE	NONE

Nor will we know how many black children lost parents or perished themselves in the multigenerational campaign of white terrorism that was Jim Crow. We do know that the Bible verse Attorney General Jeff Sessions cites in defense of seizing migrant children is the exact same scripture that defenders of slavery and Jim Crow segregation hid behind to justify their crimes. When millions of you wonder how we could have gotten here, where the president speaks of an immigrant “infestation,” where right-wing pundits dismiss the literal caging of toddlers — who have been called “child actors” — as “summer camp” and where even the ICE director won’t call such imprisonment humane, you should already know the answer.

5	NONE	"Police said the protest group at a Sydney chicken farm ignored directions to leave the property and placed chickens in cages before fleeing, causing a number of chickens to be injured or killed as a result. NSW Hen Rescue planned the protest at a farm in the city's west after reports from concerned members of the general public hens had been left with no food and no water, crammed in a shed surrounded by the dead and decomposing bodies of other animals. They claimed thousands of laying hens housed in a free-range system were already dead and more were dying before they launched into action on Thursday concerned police and RSPCA weren't doing enough. Distressing videos taken by the group as police arrested them show protesters cradling seriously ill hens that appeared to be on death's door. ""The footage shows hundreds of dead hens outside, with possibly thousands of dead bodies inside,"" they said."	AGAINST	NONE
6	NONE	In my experience, fellow Christians are quick to dismiss any notion that Christian virtues should apply to animals. Since then, my Christian witness has also included love, appreciation, and empathy for fellow creatures — creatures St. Francis would refer to as brothers and sisters. Whatever the need for animals may have been in former times, contemporary Christians in this country have a wide array of nonviolent choices. Alternatives for clothing, entertainment, household products, and many other things have eliminated the need to use animals. Clearly, the manner in which we Christians defend animal abuse has something in common with dark periods of our history.	FAVOR	NONE

Police allege the group was protesting alleged animal cruelty at the Lakesland farm, near Camden, yesterday when they the raided the property. ""A large group of protesters allegedly forced entry to the shed of a chicken farm on Mowbray Road and threatened the owner with bolt cutters,"" NSW Police said today. The group refused to leave the property and put chickens in cages before fleeing. Thirteen people - eight women, four men and a 17-year-old girl - were taken to the local police station and charged with animal cruelty."	AGAINST	NONE
8	NONE	The most common variety of common cold is rhinovirus, which accounts for around 50 per cent of all infections (it gets its name not directly from the wild animal but because 'rhino' is Greek for 'nose'). Other viruses that we also think of as the common cold include adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus. THE FACTS YOU DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THE COMMON COLD THERE ARE OVER 200 DIFFERENT STRAINS OF COLD Out of 200 different strains of cold, the rinovirus - or nose virus - is one of the most common. We found that cathelicidins from other animals such as pigs were very effective at killing this human virus, too – raising the prospect that peptides from the immune systems of other mammals could be employed to fight this infection. Now we hope to modify these peptides to make them more stable and effective, not only against rhinovirus and influenza but also against other varieties of cold virus.	AGAINST	NONE

Advertisement - Continue Reading Below As for the sexual disgust, that is triggered by situations of risky sex, like bad genital hygiene and having sex with someone shortly after meeting them. “So we tend to avoid things like off food, skin lesions, sex with promiscuous people, people with odd appearances, poor hygiene."" Advertisement - Continue Reading Below The study, from researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, asked more than 2,500 people to rate 75 scenarios from ""no disgust"" to ""extreme disgust."" In fact, women rated risky sex and animals carrying diseases as the most disgusting scenarios; where men takes more risks, women act protectively to safeguard their children and reproductive health."

10	NONE	"Professor Nicole La Gruta and Dr Kylie Quinn, from Monash University's Biomedicine Discovery Institute, have found that a subset of immune cells, called virtual memory T cells, make up around 5% of T cells in young animal models and humans but accumulate significantly with old age and lose the ability to become activated. Importantly, the Monash researchers found that another subset, called true naïve T cells, retain their capacity to mount an immune response but decline in frequency dramatically with increasing age, from 90 percent to 30 percent in animal models and humans. According to Professor La Gruta, the accumulation of dysfunctional virtual memory T cells, in addition to the loss of true naïve T cells, may explain why older people have reduced immune responses to cancer and vaccines, and why cancer immunotherapy is less successful in the elderly. According to Prof La Gruta and Dr Quinn, this may mean developing treatments to remove dysfunctional virtual memory T cells or enrich for functional true naïve T cells during cancer immunotherapy or developing treatments that reduce chronic inflammation to prevent immune decline. ""Using these observations, we may be able to tailor cancer immunotherapy specifically for the needs of an older patient's immune system- this is where medicine must head to meet the needs of our ageing society,"" Professor La Gruta said."

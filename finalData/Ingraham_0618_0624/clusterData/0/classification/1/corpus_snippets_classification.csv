2	NONE	Laura Ingraham Just Said Child Immigrant Detention Centers Are ‘Essentially Summer Camps’ (Video) A lot of people are condemning the Trump administration’s policy of separating undocumented immigrant children from their parents, especially after the release of video and images showing those children being forced into cages at detention centers on the U.S. border. But Trump can at least count on the support of Fox News host Laura Ingraham, who defended the policy on her show Monday night, saying that the centers “are essentially summer camps.” Also Read: Trevor Noah Rips Steve Doocy's 'Chain Link Fences' Comment: 'Look Man, We're Not Idiots' (Video) On Monday, the Department of Homeland Security released images from inside a detention center showing what looked quite a bit like people being held in large cages, directly contradicting previous statements by Trump defenders last week that talk of cages was overblown. Ingraham’s interesting description of summer camp isn’t the only comment out of Fox News Monday.

3	NONE	"Fox News' Laura Ingraham sparked controversy Monday night by describing government child detention facilities housing minors separated from their families as “essentially summer camps.” The Fox News anchor addressed the mounting pressure on the Trump administration to fix the issue of illegal immigrant children being separated from their families at the borders during her program on Monday, appearing to downplay the situation. https://t.co/Fzufp1Iz0p — Amy Siskind (@Amy_Siskind) June 19, 2018 Do the companies that advertise on Laura Ingraham’s show want to be associated with a host who defends the policy of separating children from their parents at the border? — David Hogg (@davidhogg111) June 19, 2018 Ingraham's comments come as both Republicans and Democrats have condemned the Trump administration's counterseal policy of separating families at the border. A report by the Associated Press last week seemed to ignite the controversy after it found that nearly 2,000 minors have already been separated from their families at the border between April 19 and May 31 as part of the Trump administrations ""zero tolerance” policy aimed at further limiting illegal entries into the U.S."	NONE	NONE
4	NONE	"Fox News host Laura Ingraham defended the Trump administration policy of separating immigrant parents and children at the border Tuesday, amid growing outcry over the ""zero tolerance"" approach, which includes housing minors in cage-like structures that resemble prisons. ""Since more illegal immigrants are rushing the border, more kids are being separated from their parents and being temporarily housed in what are essentially summer camps,"" Laura Ingraham said on her Fox News show Monday evening. ""Or, as the 'San Diego Union Tribune,' described them today... basically boarding schools."" The article that Ingraham references describes the Casa San Diego site for immigrant children, which includes classrooms, playrooms, and a medical center, and which goes on to say that the facility is ""surrounded by fencing that is backed by privacy netting, and a sign at the gate [that] warns visitors that it’s under video surveillance 24 hours per day."" If someone opens the front door of the center without first swiping a badge, the article notes, ""an alarm blares through the hallway, warning of a potential escape."""	AGAINST	NONE

9	NONE	Fox News Stands by Laura Ingraham Amid Boycott Effort Over Immigration Policy Comments Critics have called for a boycott of Laura Ingraham’s Fox News Show after she compared child immigrant detainment centers to “summer camp,” but the network is standing by her against what it calls an attempt “to silence diverse viewpoints by agenda-driven intimidation efforts.” “Laura Ingraham’s very personal, on-the-ground commitment to the plight of impoverished and abandoned children–specifically in Guatemala– speaks for itself,” Fox News said in a statement Tuesday.

10	NONE	Fox News host Laura Ingraham on Monday described the facilities that are holding immigrant children who have been separated from their parents as “essentially summer camps.” “Since more illegal immigrants are rushing the border, more kids are being separated from their parents and being housed in what are essentially summer camps, or as the San Diego Union Tribune described them today — as looking like basically boarding schools,” she said during her show “The Ingraham Angle.” Ingraham’s dismissive comments come in the wake of reports of the conditions at detention centers that are holding children who have been separated from their families as their parents are prosecuted for illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. While reporters have not been allowed to publish photos or videos of the facilities, journalists have described the children as being “incarcerated,” being held in cages and, in some cases, forced to sleep on the floor. ProPublica published an audio recording of dozens of children screaming and crying over the separation, while a border patrol agent jokes that the kids sounds like an “orchestra.”	AGAINST	NONE

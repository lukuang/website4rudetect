The donation, made on Tuesday, comes days after the ""Family Guy"" creator slammed Fox News and its host, Tucker Carlson. Taking to Twitter, McFarlane said he was embarrassed to work for Fox News, which has aired ""Family Guy"" since it premiered in 1998. Others have now joined MacFarlane in lambasting Fox News, including ""Modern Family"" creators Judd Apatow and Steve Levitan, USA Today noted.

2	NONE	"The 'Family Guy' creator shows his support for non-profit news networks after Fox News host Carlson told viewers not to believe what other news sources are reporting. The Family Guy creator's sizable donation comes after the 44-year-old criticised Fox News host Tucker Carlson for telling viewers not to believe what other news sources are reporting, unless it's making headlines on Rupert Murdoch's network. After Carlson's broadcast, MacFarlane took to social media to blast the news commentator and bosses at his station's parent company, which also hosts the actor's animated shows, including Family Guy and American Dad. Now Seth is showing his support for journalists at other news organisations by donating $2 million (£1.5 million) to officials at National Public Radio (NPR) and $500,000 (£380,000) to Los Angeles' NPR membership station KPCC. ""We are deeply appreciative of the generous gift from Seth MacFarlane, which will go to supporting local news coverage, allowing NPR and Member stations to continue working together to tell the story of the whole country from everywhere in the country,"" a statement from a NPR spokesperson to Deadline reads."

9	NONE	Over the weekend, Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane angst-tweeted about Fox News, which he labeled as “fringe sh*t” that “makes me embarrassed to work for this company.” MacFarlane was, of course, alluding to how he’s worked for decades under the 20th Century Fox umbrella that includes conservative news channel Fox News, which has sparked outrage (including from Judd Apatow) for its coverage of current border immigration practices, especially detention centers where children are separated from parents. Following MacFarlane’s tweet, Fox News executive Michael Tammero fired back to point out how Seth is “NOT quite embarrassed enough to not cash that check” while being heavily involved with multiple current Fox programs. An NPR spokesperson issued a statement of gratitude: “We are deeply appreciative of the generous gift from Seth MacFarlane, which will go to supporting local news coverage, allowing NPR and Member stations to continue working together to tell the story of the whole country from everywhere in the country.” MacFarlane hopes that his dollars will go towards countering a recent sentiment from Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who has suggested that viewers should eschew all other news outlets as untrustworthy.

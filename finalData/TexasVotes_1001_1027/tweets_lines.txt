Something >IS< happening. Perhaps it's voter suppression in Georgia, Texas and North Dakota. Maybe it's the hacking of state voter roles. Or, God forbid, it's the military hacking of actual voting machine. Two Words: Paper Ballot. And Two More Words: Weasel Face
Because Cruz knows that the voting machines and the system in Texas is fixed for him to win.

Are votes being manipulated in Texas? Why are Texans voting paperless when it’s known machines can be easily compromised by hackers? American citizens demand Paper votes.
Voter suppression tactics reported in North Carolina, Texas, Georgia, North Dakota etc. The scary part is what's not being reported. How many voting machines are being hacked? …
I felt like texas would be the test on voting machines
Texas is the state that will have the highest level of voting machine "irregularities" in the November midterms
Election integrity alert! 350 precincts voted in the Texas Dist. 19 election, which surprisingly FLIPPED RED. Of those, 221 were in blue Bexar county, the 4th largest county in TX. Bexar uses ES&S ivotronic PAPERLESS touchscreen voting machines.
Seems so clear that Beto is the clear choice to represent Texas; however, I'm completely suspicious of the GOP machine that has perfected voter suppression and compromised voting machines.
What is your solution to this problem. My solution is go back to paper. The electronic voting machines are not reliable. Even texas own investigation showed that voting machines in some counties were hacked
Do poll workers in Texas give out wretch bags or do voters just vomit on the voting machines as they vote for ?
Most voting machines in Texas are made to fail They also have no rechecking the count ability

In Harris County, Texas voting machines sit unguarded in public rooms a week before elections. They are in locked racks, but my school had a similar setup and it was easy to open when a key was lost.

I’m so afraid of the voting machine companies still selling their wares to states. The votes can be flipped or erased, & of course the Govs. & voting officials in those states are Republican. Georgia & Texas for instance, it’s not legal, it’s un-American, & we can’t stop it.
PLEASE FOCUS ON SECURE VOTING MACHINES! Paper ballots must be available. Bexar and hundreds of other Texas voting places use non-verifiable, easily hackable ES&S ivotronic touchscreen voting machines. Focus on this!
It is a twofold problem, since unverifiable paperless voting machines will muck up the final tally, but they don’t have anything to do with the polls. Texas is deep in Faux news propaganda country. Hard to get past the football jersey mentality
Voter purges only happen in states run by Republicans. If they don’t cheat, they don’t win. In Texas, for example, Rs have instituted gerrymandering and voter suppression, and to top it off they control and manipulate the electronic voting machines.

I hope you're right - Turn Texas Blue is a real thing & they've been at it for 15 years. Dead voters, illegals, rigged voting machines, big CA&NY $$$, corrupt clerks/election boards. We need a red tsunami and a miracle to defeat the fraud.
Any questions about unsecure voting machines in Texas ?
I just read 's thread on Texas' voting machines and it concerns me. I sort of recall reading something about Ohio voting abnormalities earlier today. Or else they're just narcissists?

I think it's odd that a Congresswoman from south Dallas wins by the exact same margins time after time. I also found out who owned the warehouse where those electronic voting machines are stored. Safest way to vote in Texas: On Election Day with a paper ballot.
Polls are bullshit. We learned that in 2016. Beto to is going strong here in Texas. The only way Ted will win is by cheating or with Russia manipulating our electronic voting machines.
Make sure you have a paper trail. Many Texas voting machines are computer based.

Trump says polls are “fake news” when they don’t favor his candidates. I eect foul play, massive vote purging of Dem voters as in Georgia, Indiana, Texas, and hacking of vulnerable voting machines that Rs refused to protect. Trump is cocky because the fix is already in place.
Texas uses hackable untraceable banned electronic voting machines.
Can’t be too careful the crooked Soros machines out there. It’s% truth, happened in Texas Nov 2016. Gov Abbott had a mess on his hands. Voting isn’t fireproof, sadly. Different times; Democrats aren’t really original Democrat Party. That’s why people WalkAwayFromDemocrats2018
No as Jill Steins recount revealed & Texas voting machine revealed fraud was much more prevalent that imaginary suppression.DNC bused ppl in 2 vote out of district they can bus them 2 the DMV also. Nobody with a brain buys the suppression BS. It’s too stupid to even try.
New technique to mess up The vote in Texas- jamming the voting machines. Then someone moves the uncounted votes to counted votes. Caught them and it changed the election for a Democrat! Being done all over Texas but people are not catching it!
Our elections director was charged with fraud in the Philippine elections but was hired anyway.He was a director of a corporation who sells voting machines. Do you think elections are going to be fair? Three of our Texas legislators recently went to Russia!Trouble in Tarrant Co.
I'm sure the Texas GOP is trying to lock up that vote for you, Raphael. What's on the agenda? People who are registered finding out they've been scrubbed? Certain areas having "problems" with their voting machines? How are you going to cheat your way around this?

You need to follow and see why there is such a concern about the electronic voting machines in several major states like Texas, Florida, Illinois etc. As long as these machines can be manipulated it won't matter how many turn out.
Wish I could vote for O'Rourke, Nelson, Collier and Allred too, to help Texas. I feel blessed to have two wonderful Senators Merkley and Wyden in Oregon. We vote by mail, so we don't have to worry about hacked voting machines. But, last minute purging voters by hackers is a worry
TEXAS, if you can't get paper ballots, watch out bc I hear they're busy PURGING voters from certain areas. Voting machines could be messed up knowing the governor & other states are having trouble with their machines! Do whatever you can to be careful & cover all your bases!
Is there a petition I can sign and share that encapsulates both the cellular modems on voting machines and the lack of a paper trail in states like Texas? Even one that can be circulated to Republicans since nominally election fraud worries them too?
Texas - We have voting machines. Nuff said.

1	NONE	NAIL bars, hand car washes and construction sites have been visited by police as part of a crackdown on modern slavery and human trafficking. Teams also visited construction sites and agricultural businesses to make sure companies were complying with policies and keeping staff safe. Officers also visited two construction sites in York as part of the operation to look at the working conditions of security guards on site and found concerning working practices, which were recorded and reported back to the relevant agencies to be followed up. Human trafficking involves moving individuals so that they can be exploited while victims of modern slavery are people viewed as a commodity to be traded or exploited. Police are urging residents who suspect someone is a victim of modern slavery or human trafficking to report it to them on 101, or to phone the modern slavery helpline on 08000121700 or Crimestoppers on 0800555111.

2	NONE	More than 3,000 businesses in Australia would be forced to disclose how they tackle the threat of modern slavery under a proposed law hailed by politicians and campaigners on Thursday as stronger than Britain’s landmark anti-slavery legislation. The Australian government said it would introduce its Modern Slavery Act to parliament by mid-2018, and outlined on Thursday its requirements which will compel large companies to publish an annual public statement on their actions to address slavery. “This … takes the Australian Modern Slavery Act beyond its precursor in the UK, which is currently the gold standard for modern slavery reporting, by including a central repository of statements,” said Jenn Morris, head of the Walk Free Foundation. Australia has committed A$3.6 million to establish a business unit which would manage the repository and advise companies on modern slavery risks in their supply chains. “ This … takes the Australian Modern Slavery Act beyond its precursor in the UK, which is currently the gold standard for modern slavery reporting, by including a central repository of statements.

3	NONE	An inquiry by the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Prostitution and the Global Sex Trade has revealed that the sexual exploitation of women in ‘pop-up’ brothels by organised crime groups is taking place on an industrial scale across England and Wales. During the course of the APPG’s inquiry, we took evidence from half of all police forces in England and Wales – accompanying officers on brothel visits, speaking with police leaders, as well as taking evidence from those that sell sex - to build up the most comprehensive contemporary picture of the nature of off-street prostitution in this country. The pattern of commercial sexual exploitation in this country is changing, but the challenge to lawmakers remains the same as it ever was - to take action to reduce the scale and impact of prostitution and end demand for the trafficking of women into and around the United Kingdom. Our report - Behind closed doors: organised sexual exploitation in England and Wales - provides practical solutions, building on two previous reports by the APPG on Prostitution that looked at the right legal settlement on prostitution, and on how to implement an effective sex buyer law. Prostitution procurements websites that organised crime groups use to advertise women to sex buyers must also be targeted, with the owners and operators of these sites held legally accountable for facilitating and profiting from sexual exploitation.

4	NONE	"MPs called for the criminalisation of paying for sex after research found so-called “pop-up brothels” – premises rented for short periods of time to sexually exploit women – were widespread, with hundreds of vulnerable women, predominantly from Eastern Europe, being supplied by trafficking gangs into residential properties in order to be sexually exploited by British men. There are at least 212 active, ongoing police operations in the UK into modern slavery cases involving sexual exploitation, and it is overwhelmingly foreign national women who are being exploited in British brothels, the report found. The inquiry found that organised crime groups typically advertise women to sex buyers on commercial websites such as Vivastreet or Adultwork, with one man being investigated for sex trafficking spending over £20,000 placing adverts of women on one commercial website. Gavin Shuker MP, chair of the APPG, said sexual exploitation of women by organised crime groups was taking place on an “industrial scale”, with a ""revolving door of vulnerable women being supplied by trafficking gangs into pop-up brothels. ""Organised crime groups should also be disrupted by cracking down on the prostitution websites they use to advertise women to sex buyers."	NONE	NONE

9	NONE	By Richard BransonAt Virgin, we have adopted an Anti-Slavery Policy which sets out our zero-tolerance stance on slavery and trafficking Modern slavery and gender-based violence (GBV) are deplorable human rights violations that endure around the world. Women and girls account for a staggering 71 percent of modern slavery victims, 99 percent of those forced into sexual exploitation, and 84 percent of those forced into marriage. Businesses around the world have to play a key role in ending GBV and slavery. It is time for business leaders to demand that slavery, forced labour and violence play no part in their companies or their sphere of influence. Modern slavery and GBV continue to exist because systems of domination, violence and abuse are acceptable to many of those in positions of power.	NONE	NONE

The all-party parliamentary group on prostitution and the global sex trade says websites should be banned from advertising sex and women who work in the industry should be decriminalised. Gavin Shuker MP, chairman of the group, told Sky News: ""The government should take measures to end demand for prostitution, which means shifting the burden of criminality from those that sell sex to those that buy it. Cari Mitchell, from the English Collective of Prostitutes, told Sky News: ""The number of women who are trafficked in the sex industry is about 6%."	AGAINST	NONE

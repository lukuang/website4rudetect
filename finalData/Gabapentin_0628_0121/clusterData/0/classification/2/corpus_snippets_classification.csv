1	NONE	We retrospectively explored whether there is a clinically relevant association between intraoperative hypothermia and POI in patients who underwent laparoscopic colorectal surgery for malignancy within the setting of an enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) program between April 2016 and January 2017 at our institution. Although the mean lowest core temperature was lower in patients with POI than those without POI (35.3 ± 0.5°C vs. 35.5 ± 0.5°C, P = 0.004), the independence of intraoperative hypothermia was not confirmed based on multivariate logistic regression analysis. In addition to three variables (high age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index score, long duration of surgery, high maximum pain score during the first 3 days postoperatively), cumulative dose of rescue opioids used during the first 3 days postoperatively was identified as an independent risk factor of POI (odds ratio = 1.027 for each 1-morphine equivalent [mg] increase, 95% confidence interval = 1.014–1.040, P <0.001). The purpose of this study was to determine whether there is a clinically relevant association between intraoperative hypothermia and POI within the setting of an ERAS pathway in adult patients who have undergone laparoscopic colorectal surgery. To avoid possible spurious associations, data were collected on patient demographics, social habits such as current smoking and alcohol abuse, comorbidity status, intraoperative data (duration of surgery and anesthesia, type of surgery and anesthesia, infused volume of IV fluids, estimated blood loss), and postoperative analgesia-related data (maximum pain [NRS] score and cumulative dose of rescue opioids used during the first 3 days postoperatively).

2	NONE	Exclusion criteria were patients on renal replacement therapy (RRT), cardiac trauma surgery, heart transplantation, patients with ventricular assist devices, subjects who required a surgical revision for bleeding and those whose medical records were incomplete. Patients were divided into 2 groups whether they had received a cumulative HES dose of < 30 mL/kg (Low HES) or ≥ 30 mL/kg (High HES) during the intra- and postoperative period.

(2017) The dose of hydroxyethyl starch 6% 130/0.4 for fluid therapy and the incidence of acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery: A retrospective matched study. The results of a recent retrospective study suggested that using HES 6% 130/0.4 for cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) prime and intraoperative fluid therapy at an average dose of 30 mL/kg was associated with a greater incidence of AKI after on-pump adult cardiac surgery when compared with fluid therapy based on crystalloids only [13]. Patients were arbitrarily divided into 2 groups according to the cumulative dose of HES 6% 130/0.4 they had received during the entire intra- and postoperative period.	FAVOR	NONE
3	NONE	SPP and serum lactate level were assessed after anaesthesia induction (baseline), during CPB, after CPB-off, end of surgery, arrival at intensive care unit, and postoperative 6 h. Lactate was further measured until postoperative 48 h. Association of SPP with lactate and 30-day morbidity comprising myocardial infarction, acute kidney injury, stroke, prolonged intubation, sternal infection, reoperation, and mortality was assessed. The SPP value during CPB and its % change from the baseline value were significantly associated with the postoperative 6 h peak lactate (r = -0.26, P = 0.030 and r = 0.47, P = 0.001, respectively). Decrease in SPP >48% during CPB from baseline value was associated with a 12.8-fold increased risk of composite endpoint of 30-day morbidity (95% CI, 1.48–111.42; P = 0.021) on multivariate logistic regression. Hence, we aimed to investigate the role of perioperative SPP monitoring as an indicator of tissue perfusion assessed by serum lactate levels in patients receiving valvular heart surgery using CPB. From our institution’s previous database, we obtained a correlation coefficient (r) of -0.20 (P = 0.128) between the average of CRSO 2 values during surgery and postoperative 48 h peak lactate level in 200 adult patients undergoing valvular heart surgery.

4	NONE	BACKGROUND: Neurological adverse events with spinal cord ischemia (SCI) remain one of the most feared complications in patients undergoing thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR). CASE PRESENTATION: We herein present a patient who developed SCI with bilateral lower leg paraplegia on the third postoperative day following TEVAR. The patient exhibited significant neurological recovery following these treatments, and he ultimately regained full neurological function without spinal deficit. DISCUSSION: This represents the first reported case of full neurological recovery of a patient who developed complete SCI following TEVAR procedure. The neurological recovery was due in part to immediate therapeutic hypothermia and hyperbaric oxygen therapy which reversed the spinal ischemia.	AGAINST	NONE
5	NONE	A new clinical study has demonstrated the warming and cooling capabilities of Attune Medical’s EnsoETM esophageal temperature management device, suggesting that it can be used to supplement surface warming devices, provide warming in cases not amenable to surface warming, and supplement, or possibly even replace, catheter-based cooling devices. Using the esophageal space to provide temperature management combines the benefits of a non-invasive approach with direct access to the patient’s core, delivering unique advantages in temperature-based clinical management of warming and/or cooling applications. Formerly known as Advanced Cooling Therapy, Attune Medical has developed proprietary medical device technology that simplifies access to the patient’s core to efficiently control core temperature. Attune’s initial product, the EnsoETM (formerly Esophageal Cooling Device or ECD), is designed to modulate and control patient temperature through a single-use, fully-enclosed system that is inserted into the esophagus. Attune Medical (as Advanced Cooling Therapy) received US FDA de novo clearance for the EnsoETM (Esophageal Cooling Device or ECD) in 2015 for use with the Medi-Therm III by Stryker®.	AGAINST	NONE
6	NONE	The majority of deaths in this period are due to hemorrhage and/or traumatic brain injury (TBI). Despite numerous advances in trauma care, a recent multinational trial of more than 20,000 patients [3] demonstrated that most deaths occur within a few hours of injury, with <2.5% of the injured succumbing to multiple organ failure. In fact, a single dose of VPA, even in the absence of conventional resuscitation strategies, has been shown to improve survival and mitigate organ damage in models of lethal hemorrhage [8], poly-trauma [9,10], septic shock [11], ischemia-reperfusion injury [12], and TBI [13]. Working with clinically relevant large-animal models of TBI and hemorrhagic shock (HS), we have shown that a single dose of VPA can attenuate brain lesion size, inflammation, and edema within 6 hours of treatment [16]. Our team has used clinically realistic large-animal models of lethal vascular injuries and soft tissue trauma to demonstrate that profound hypothermia can be induced through an emergency thoracotomy approach for total body protection, with excellent long-term survival and no neurological damage or significant organ dysfunction, and that otherwise lethal vascular injuries, above and below the diaphragm, can be repaired under hypothermic arrest with greater than 75% long-term survival [30].

7	NONE	The objectives of this study were to assess the effects of intraperitoneal (IP) ketamine (95 mg/kg) and xylazine (7 mg/kg) alone or combined with lidocaine at 4, 8, or 16 mg/kg on time to loss (LRR) and return (RRR) of righting reflex, duration of immobilization and loss of pedal withdrawal response (PWR), body weight and histopathology in CD-1 mice. Lidocaine administered with ketamine and xylazine shortens the onset of anesthesia in mice and improves anesthetic depth without prolonging recovery time. The current study was performed to determine how the inclusion of lidocaine in ketamine/xylazine-anesthetized mice would affect the duration of anesthesia, response to noxious stimulation, changes in post-anesthetic body weight and histopathologic findings following intraperitoneal injection in CD-1 mice. The hypothesis tested was that the addition of lidocaine to an IP injection of ketamine and xylazine in mice would result in a more rapid induction and a deeper plane of anesthesia. Total volumes for IP injection were no greater than 20μL/g. Mice were randomly assigned by use of a random number generator ( random.org ) to one of 5 groups: saline control (SA, n = 4); ketamine-xylazine (KX, n = 8); ketamine-xylazine-lidocaine 4mg/kg (KXL4, n = 8); ketamine-xylazine-lidocaine 8mg/kg (KXL8, n = 8); ketamine-xylazine-lidocaine 16mg/kg (KXL16, n = 8).

8	NONE	Notably, IκK-16 decreased miR-155 expression with a corresponding dose-dependent decrease in TNF-α and IL-10 production (P < 0.05), and impaired monocyte function was associated with increased miR-155 and miR-138 expression. These data demonstrate that IκK-16 treatment attenuates the monocyte inflammatory response, which may occur through a miR-155-mediated mechanism, and that IκK-16 is a promising approach to limit the magnitude of an excessive innate inflammatory response to LPS. Impaired monocyte function is one facet of immune dysregulation that continues to be recognized as a central tenant of trauma- or sepsis-related immunosuppression [ 5 , 6 ]. After initial treatment of control (DMSO) or 100 nM IκK-16 for 1 h, monocytes were transfected with miR-155 mimics or antagomirs (Life Technologies, Foster City, CA, USA) at a concentration of 40 nM/well for 16 h. Control cells were transfected with scramble miRs as a negative control (sham). Gels were run in a Bolt TM Mini Gel Tank in Bolt MES SDS running buffer (all from Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) at 180 mV for 45 min, which included a protein size standard (Protein Western C Standard, Bio Rad, Hercules, CA).

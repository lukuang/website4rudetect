1	NONE	Doctors are prescribing the anti-seizure drugs gabapentin (Neurontin) and pregabalin (Lyrica) to treat pain more frequently, partly in response to the opioid epidemic in the United States, said Dr. Allan Brett. Brett said that gabapentin and pregabalin originally were developed as anti-seizure drugs for epilepsy, but clinical trials found the drugs also showed promise in relieving certain kinds of nerve-related pain. Doctors struggling to ease patients' pain without resorting to opioids appear to be turning to the anti-seizure drugs, even in cases where the pain doesn't fall under FDA guidelines, Brett said. Beyond ineffectiveness against pain and side effects, there is some evidence that patients might misuse the two drugs to get high, Brett and Sood noted. Instead of relying on such opioid alternatives, physicians would do better to steer patients towards non-drug means of pain management, Brett said.	NONE	NONE

4	NONE	Even hardened cynics may wince over the findings of a new report from US senator Claire McCaskill outlining a drug company’s elaborate scheme to get paid for a cancer pain medication by faking disease diagnoses. The Arizona-based pharmaceutical maker Insys Therapeutics allegedly falsified patient files, manipulated insurer approval processes, and bribed doctors into prescribing the opioid fentanyl to patients who didn’t need it, according to the Sept. 6 report titled “Fueling an Epidemic: Insys Therapeutics and the Systemic Manipulation of Prior Authorization.” To get that approval for Subsys, doctors’ offices must confirm that the patient in question has an active cancer diagnosis, is being treated with an opioid (so is opioid tolerant), but that drug isn’t quelling “breakthrough pain.” Working with crooked doctors, drug company representatives allegedly led insurers to believe that patients did indeed have breakthrough cancer pain even when they didn’t have cancer. On the call, the Insys employee refers repeatedly to “breakthrough pain” when asked about the patient’s diagnosis, avoiding use of the word “cancer.”	NONE	NONE
5	NONE	"Until he began working at NSW's Nabiac Village Medical Practice in 2013, Dr Arreza's experience of prescribing had been exclusively in hospitals where opioids are frequently provided for severe acute pain after childbirth, cancer, a car accident or surgery. A senior doctor, John Olsen, told the Tribunal that Dr Arreza's ""sympathetic compassion"" made him vulnerable to patients who doctor shopped. In the case of a drug dependent patient with right knee pain known only as Patient B, Dr Arreza was found to have inappropriately prescribed a combination of fentanyl, oxycodone and temazepam from April 2013 to March 2014. Yet many doctors in their early careers found it was difficult to help patients stop opioids, a study by Dr Holliday found. The Tribunal banned Dr Arreza from administering, supplying or prescribing any drug of addiction (except in the case of palliative care) for one year and he was required to practice under the supervision of another doctor for a year."

6	NONE	In detailing Insys’ practices, the Oregon DOJ cited its relationship with Rosenblum, who it said has “a long history of speaking on behalf of pharmaceutical companies about drugs, including drugs that were unlawfully promoted off-label to treat certain types of pain.” Rosenblum said he, too, had concerns about Insys and ultimately discontinued his relationship with the company. They worry about sanctions by the medical board and scrutiny from the (Drug Enforcement Administration), and they worry about trying to keep to the standard of care for pain management,” said Rosenblum, whose clinic is in Northwest Portland. Rosenblum supports adoption of a “morphine equivalent” dosage benchmark to mitigate overdoses, encouraging the use of abuse-deterrent technology and providing doctors with a “chronic pain tool kit.” Rosenblum said there are “other tools” he can use as a pain specialist, including implanted spinal infusion pumps.

(Source: NBC12) In the midst of a nationwide opioid addiction crisis, a different type of drug may be slipping in under the radar. ""We found a nearly 3,000 percent increase from 2008 to about 2014 in individuals reporting gabapentin abuse,"" said Vickers-Smith. Experts say gabapentin is typically misused by substance abusers who mix it with other drugs. Experts stress that gabapentin abuse is not the next opioid epidemic, but they believe it is something to watch closely."	NONE	NONE
8	NONE	Researchers conclude that regular doctor visits, counseling, and minimizing drug treatments can reduce the risk of death for people with opioid addictions. The one-third reduction is significant because it applies to people with opioid addictions, even if they are not actively seeking treatment. “Even though treatment is really important, specifically medication assisted treatment, there are many people with opioid use disorders who don’t want treatment,” Dr. Katherine Watkins, a board-certified practicing psychiatrist, and lead author of the RAND study, told Healthline. Watkins and her team studied seven major healthcare factors to examine what the effects would be on the mortality rate in people with opioid addictions.

9	NONE	Is gabapentin (Neurontin, others) an effective fibromyalgia treatment? Answers from Kevin C. Fleming, M.D. Anti-seizure drugs, such as gabapentin, are often used to treat chronic pain. Pregabalin (Lyrica), a drug similar to gabapentin, was the first medication approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat fibromyalgia. While gabapentin hasn't been approved by the FDA for the treatment of fibromyalgia, some doctors may prescribe it off-label for such use. Gabapentin and pregabalin were originally approved to treat certain types of epilepsy and nerve pain.	FAVOR	NONE
10	NONE	One way to prevent opioid addiction: Stop people from being unnecessarily prescribed powerful pain medication in the first place. It measures the likelihood that someone will develop chronic pain — a leading cause of opioid dependency — and suffer complications in their recovery. Dr. Adam Seidner, global medical director at Travelers, said the algorithm identifies potential triggers among a massive trove of case files of workplace injuries that might predispose certain people to chronic pain. The type of injury is also a potential trigger for chronic paint that, if not treated early, could result in more expensive surgery and opioid use. The manufacturing, services, healthcare and construction industries are also higher risk for the kind of chronic pain that results in opioid prescriptions.	FAVOR	NONE

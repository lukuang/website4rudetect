(Source: File Photo) Scientists have discovered a powerful pain reliever that is effective in alleviating neuropathic pain, a discovery that could be instrumental in addressing the opioid abuse epidemic, one of the biggest public health challenges today. The new pain drug binds to a receptor on cells throughout the central nervous system called the sigma 2 receptor. “This opens the door to having a new treatment for neuropathic pain that is not an opioid,” said Stephen Martin, Professor at The University of Texas at Austin. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, nearly two million people in the US suffer from addiction to prescription opioid pain relievers.	FAVOR	NONE

3	NONE	CHARLESTON – As the chief legal officers of our states, myself and other attorneys general are taking action on many fronts to fight the opioid epidemic.We recognize that the devastating cost of addiction demands an unyielding commitment that utilizes every tool at our disposal.This shared determination drove a broad, bipartisan group of 37 attorneys general, led by my office, to call upon health insurance companies to assess their impact on the crisis, and evaluate and determine appropriate incentives to reduce the use of opioids as a first line therapy option.Promoting non-opioid therapies, for instance, will help ensure trade groups and major insurance providers do not unintentionally contribute to the opioid epidemic — the preeminent public health crisis of our time.The facts are clear.The status quo cannot continue.Opioid overdoses kill 91 Americans every single day, and more than half of those deaths involve prescription opioids.Statistics indicate that as many as 2 million Americans are addicted to or otherwise dependent upon prescription opioids. More than 50 percent of people who misuse these medications report they obtained them free from a friend or relative, while another 22 percent abused prescription painkillers obtained directly from a doctor.These statistics underscore the need for change, and we believe insurance companies can play a major role in turning the tide.Our coalition of attorneys general is sending letters to insurance companies urging each to review its coverage and payment policies. We hope this starts a dialogue to make sure incentive structures reward the use of non-opioid pain management techniques and does not improperly incentivize opioids, when they are not medically necessary.Such a discussion is important because medical care providers often favor treatment options that are most likely to be compensated, either by an insurance provider or other means.While there are certainly situations where opioids represent the appropriate pain remedy, such highly addictive pain pills can no longer be the first choice in treating the majority of aches and pains.Revised insurance policies can drive much positive change. The companies’ cooperation will play an important role in making it easier for patients to access other forms of pain management such as over-the-counter pain relievers, physical therapy, acupuncture, massage and chiropractic care.These options are far less dangerous and much more effective for long-term relief.This strategy will lead to significantly fewer opioid prescriptions, however, insurance companies represent just one aspect of the solution. We must hold all stakeholders accountable and work with every available resource to attack this from a supply, demand and educational perspective.That’s why my office has partnered with elementary, middle and high schools, along with universities, the faith-based community, trade groups and other government agencies to promote best practices and emphasize the importance of preventing future addiction.Our attorneys prosecute drug dealers and file lawsuits against all culpable parts of the pharmaceutical supply chain, as evidenced by eight criminal convictions, the shutting down of a pain clinic and $47 million in settlements with 12 drug wholesalers, a record-breaking amount for West Virginia.These accomplishments and our newest initiative prove that when everyone works together, we can make a major difference in the fight against opioid abuse.It will not be easy, and the road to change will require every tool at our disposal, but I am confident our efforts will help West Virginia reach her full potential.Morrisey is the Attorney General of West Virginia	FAVOR	NONE
4	NONE	(KXAN) As law enforcement agencies and community groups look for solutions to the escalating abuse of opioids in the United States, they may find an answer in the hands of a few University of Texas at Austin scientists. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, opioids include heroin, synthetic opioids like fentanyl, and pain relievers that can be obtained through prescriptions like oxycodone, hydrocodone and morphine. While opioid prescription pain relievers can be useful for short term pain relief, regular use — even as prescribed — can lead to dependence and overdose. But what if there were a way to prescribe pain relievers that didn’t lead to addiction? Stephen Martin and James Sahn say their team has discovered a powerful new pain reliever that works in a previously unknown pathway of the brain.	NONE	NONE
5	NONE	"Chemical & Engineering News (C&EN), the weekly newsmagazine of the American Chemical Society, explores how abuse-deterring and novel formulations for painkillers in addition to crime-fighting tools to quickly identify opioids could help curb the crisis. But these abuse-deterrent opioids are nearly double the price of the original formulation - literally a high price for patients who need the medications for relief from extreme pain. In other pharmaceutical efforts to help combat the epidemic, some labs are looking to replace opioids altogether with novel and equally effective painkillers. On another front in this fight, scientists are developing powerful opioid detectors to help law enforcement officers quickly identify the drugs on the street and minimize officers' own risk of exposure.

6	NONE	Scientists at the military’s Walter Reed Army Institute of Research announced today that they’ve developed a heroin vaccine that can block the euphoric effects of opioids in the brain—and do so without interfering with other therapies used to treat addiction. The Walter Reed scientists found no such cross-reaction between their vaccine and those compounds, nor did they find any interference with naloxone, the drug used to reverse opioid overdoses. So they tested the antibodies produced by their vaccine and discovered that they did not bind to certain other narcotics, like tramadol, nor did they bind to non-narcotic pain relievers such as acetaminophen. In September, the Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute won a grant from the NIH to develop a drug that targets metabotropic glutamate receptor 2 (mGlu2), which they believe might eliminate the influence of opioids on environmental cues that drive addiction, such as positive memories. Preventing opioids from getting into the brain altogether is the aim of the new vaccine being developed at Walter Reed.	NONE	NONE
7	NONE	"The research analyzed records of more than 7,000 surgical patients from 2013 through 2015, and the authors concluded that 80 percent of prescriptions exceeded new state guidelines for opioid use.That's worrisome information, especially in light of the well-deserved attention being paid to the nation's epidemic of opioid addiction and abuse, but this isn't a ""smoking gun"" moment that discredits Mayo Clinic and its doctors.Quite the opposite, in fact.For starters, the study of these 7,000 surgical patients was performed by Mayo Clinic researchers, including a general surgery resident and the scientific director of surgical outcomes research at Mayo's Robert D. and Patricia E. Kern Center for the Science of Health Care Delivery.So Mayo studied the prescribing habits of its own doctors, then published the results. The clinic acknowledges that over-prescribing opioids is a problem on its campuses, and Mayo is beginning to develop tiered guidelines for various procedures so that doctors have better protocols to guide them in managing patients' pain. ""For some of the procedures, the guideline is probably appropriate and we have an opportunity to reduce the amount prescribed,"" said Dr. Elizabeth Habermann, the study's senior author.We have no doubt that over time, Mayo doctors will prescribe smaller doses of opioids. Gone are the days when patients were expected to sit quietly, listen to the all-knowing doctor and blindly follow his or her orders.Modern medicine requires communication, and patients can and do play an active role in determining the best course of treatment.That's why patients need to fully understand the risks of opioids and have realistic expectations regarding pain management. Just because a pill can make pain go away doesn't mean it should be prescribed, no matter how eagerly the patient might ask for it.But the sad fact is that even if Mayo becomes the new model for how to manage pain with the minimum of opioids, we'll lose the battle against opioid abuse unless other doctors and health systems across the nation unite behind the same goal.Republished with permission.WANT TO ADD YOUR VOICE?If you're interested in joining the discussion, add your voice to the Comment section below — or consider writing a letter or a longer-form Community Voices commentary."

8	NONE	"WASHINGTON -- The FDA on Tuesday issued a final guidance document to help companies develop generic versions of approved abuse-deterrent opioids. ""Until we're able to find new non-opioid forms of pain management for those who need treatment for pain, it's critical that we also continue to promote the development of opioids that are harder to manipulate and abuse, and take steps to encourage their use over opioids that don't offer any form of abuse deterrence."" The guidance issued on Tuesday ""includes new recommendations about the type of studies companies should conduct to demonstrate that the generic drug is no less abuse-deterrent than its brand-name counterpart,"" Gottlieb said. ""We're also taking additional steps beyond the new guidance to help developers of generic ADFs navigate the regulatory path to market as quickly as possible and make the review process more efficient and predictable."" ""As we balance the need to effectively treat pain with the public health emergency related to opioid addiction, we must find creative ways to prevent new cases of abuse and addiction."""

9	NONE	The study showcases a device that uses ultrasound waves to trigger nerve-blocking agents within the patient. “We envision that patients could get an injection at the hospital and then bring home a small, portable ultrasound device for triggering the nerve-blocking agent. The system involves tiny sacs that filled with nerve-blocking drugs; this is then injected into the patient through a syringe. “This opens the surface of the liposomes and releases the nerve-blocking drug into the local tissue, reducing pain.” The need for alternative pain relief systems is amplified due to the increasing abuse rate of various narcotic drugs such as Tramadol.

""By eliciting antibodies that bind with heroin in the blood, the vaccine aims to block the euphoria and addictive effects,"" said Dr. Gary Matyas, Chief of Adjuvants and Formulations for the U.S. Military Research Program (MHRP), WRAIR. Researchers found that the antibodies did not react with these compounds and, more importantly, the antibodies induced by the vaccine did not cross-react with naloxone, which is used as the overdose rescue treatment to reverse respiratory depression due to heroin and other opioid overdose. WRAIR researchers leveraged their expertise in vaccine development and novel adjuvants research to develop this experimental heroin vaccine with their partners at NIDA. The U.S. Military HIV Research Program (MHRP), centered at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), aims to protect the U.S. Military from HIV and improve global health by conducting research to develop an HIV vaccine, reduce new infections and advance strategies to induce long-term HIV remission."

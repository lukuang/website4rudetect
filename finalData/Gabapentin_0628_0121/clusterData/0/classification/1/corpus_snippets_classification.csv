1	NONE	In this study, our results demonstrate for the first time that SMF could enhance the anti-cancer effect of natural compound, capsaicin, on HepG2 cancer cells through the mitochondria-dependent apoptosis pathway. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the synergistic anti-cancer effect of SMF and capsaicin on HepG2 cells. In this paper, we study the combinational anti-cancer effects of SMF with capsaicin by means of the cell viability as well as light microscopy. Our results demonstrated that SMF enhanced the effect of natural compound, capsaicin, to inhibit the growth of cancer cells for the first time. (A) Dose-response curve of HepG2 cells treated with different concentrations of capsaicin for 72 h. (B) Cells were treated with different concentrations of capsaicin with or without 0.5 T SMF for 72 h and then the residual cell viability was measured by MTT assay.	FAVOR	NONE
2	NONE	Therefore, the typical intracellular signaling pathway following the activation of β receptors and the activation of PKA does not seem to be involved in the inhibitory effect of NA on capsaicin currents in DRG neurons. The results that yohimbine antagonized the inhibitory effect of noradrenaline and that clonidine inhibited capsaicin currents suggest the possibility that the activation of α -adrenoceptors suppresses TRPV1 activity, and this effect of NA is expected to have a role in pain relief. In addition, intracellular dialysis with GDPβS and the pretreatment of neurons with PTX blocked the effects of NA, strongly suggesting that the activation of α -adrenoceptors and the subsequent activation of G proteins are involved in the inhibitory effect of NA on capsaicin currents. NA and clonidine inhibit the sustained phase of capsaicin currents [24], and this inhibitory effect depends on CAMKII activity, such as the actions of D1 and D5 dopaminergic receptors on TRPV1 channels [41]. NA may show an inhibitory effect on capsaicin currents depending on the dephosphorylation of TRPV1 channels and/or related proteins in DRG neurons through the inhibition of the activity of AC following the activation of α -adrenoceptors.

3	NONE	Capsaicin-sensitive sensory C-fibers derived from vagal ganglia innervate the visceral organs, and respond to inflammatory mediators and noxious stimuli. Vagal sensory neurons are located in two ganglia, the jugular ganglia (derived from the neural crest), and the nodose ganglia (from the epibranchial placodes). In addition to dorsal root ganglia (DRG), a sizeable proportion of the visceral nociceptive innervation is derived from small capsaicin-sensitive (TRPV1-expressing) C-fiber neurons in vagal sensory ganglia. Another less appreciated component of the vagal C-fiber innervation of visceral tissues is the fibers derived from neurons situated in the jugular (supranodose) ganglia. Both compartments were separately superfused with Krebs solution, which was warmed by a warming jacket (39–42°C) to keep airway tissues and ganglia at 37°C. Action potentials were recorded at the level of the cell body strategically positioned in the vagal sensory ganglion using a sharp extracellular glass electrode filled with 3M NaCl (impedance 2MΩ).

4	NONE	What happens to your brain & body when you eat spicy food. Hot peppers trick your brain into thinking your mouth is on fire. It's all about a chemical compound in peppers called capsaicin. Capsaicin binds to pain receptors on our nerves called TRPV1. Capsaicin causes TRPV1 to send those same signals.	NONE	NONE

7	NONE	The strong and sometimes overwhelming effects that come with eating spicy food are caused by one small chemical found in chili peppers: capsaicin. Although chilies are found in many dishes throughout the world, capsaicin is actually a neurotoxin and in large enough concentrations can cause seizures, heart attacks, and even death. Ruari Barratt, a freelance journalist working in the UK, knows firsthand the effects of eating too much capsaicin after a burger laced with concentrated piri piri chili sauce from India sent him to the hospital. The reason for this false heat sensation is capsaicin’s ability to latch onto pain receptors known as TRPV1, which are normally only activated in the presence of heat. For many, especially those not accustomed to eating spicy food, too much capsaicin in a dish can upset the digestive tract.	FAVOR	NONE

9	NONE	I love spicy foods and enjoy the benefits of the spicy chemical in peppers — capsaicin — that may improve health. The chemical in peppers, capsaicin, that generates the heat, is believed to irritate the nerve that triggers hiccups.6 Others believe the chemical is released in the mouth in a fine spray that enters the lungs and disrupts the normal rhythm of the diaphragm.7 As your diaphragm begins to contract and relax to expel the substance from your lungs, it triggers a hiccup. Most of these patients were over 50 and had other health conditions.9 According to the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine:10 Irritation to the nerves that serve your diaphragm is often the cause for long-term hiccups and may be triggered by gastroesophageal reflux, laryngitis, a tumor, cyst or goiter in your neck or even a hair touching your eardrum.11 Other causes may be related to infection, damage or trauma to your central nervous system, including stroke, head injury, tumor or multiple sclerosis. Researchers have discovered including spicy foods may help shrink fat cells and lower blood fat levels.18 Past research has suggested that thermogenic ingredients, or those compounds that increase your body’s heat production, may increase your metabolism by up to 5 percent and the ability of your body to burn fat by up to 16 percent.19 Capsaicin is a thermogenic substance that may temporarily increase the ability of your body to burn fat to produce heat. In a journal article in Open Heart, scientists explored a mechanism that may explain the favorable results researchers have found in animal studies using capsaicin-rich diets, including a positive effect on health conditions such as metabolic syndrome, obesity, hypertension, atherosclerosis and stroke.20 As capsaicin thins mucus, it may help to clear your lungs during an illness, strengthen your lung capacity and may help prevent or treat emphysema.21 Various studies also demonstrate that capsaicin may effectively help your body fight prostate cancer.22 Animal studies have found oral supplementation is effective against H. pylori, the bacteria that triggers gastritis and ulcerations of the stomach wall.

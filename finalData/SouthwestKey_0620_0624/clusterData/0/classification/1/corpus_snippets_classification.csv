1	NONE	"Ernesto Padron worked at Austin-based nonprofit Southwest Key's Casa Padre shelter last year, where, as a case manager, he had direct access to unaccompanied immigrant minors. The spokesperson said Padron remained suspended until May 2017, when he was one of 966 employees laid off by Southwest Key after the number of unaccompanied minors crossing the border decreased significantly that year, reducing the staffing needs throughout the nonprofit's shelters. On January 7, 2008, an undercover FBI agent initiated an online chat session with Padron, and material alleged to be child pornography was exchanged, according to a statement from the Cameron County District Attorney's Office. ""In our hiring, extensive background checks are conducted on applicants; however, because Mr. Padron was not convicted of the charges you referenced (or any other disqualifying criminal charges), he was cleared for employment,"" Southwest Key spokesperson Lizzie Chen wrote in an emailed statement to Texas Monthly. That Padron was still able to secure a job working directly with young children raises questions about Southwest Key's ability to background check its employees, as well as the quality of care and safety of the children under its charge."

2	NONE	Ernesto Padron resigned from the agency in October 2010 after he was arrested on suspicion of possession of child pornography in Brownsville, Texas, following an FBI sting two years prior. However, an investigation from Texas Monthly revealed that Padron went on to get a job as a case manager at Southwest Key’s Casa Padre shelter. The prosecution of Padron’s case stalled under Cameron County's then district attorney Armando Villalobos, who was later indicted on corruption charges and jailed for 13 years. “In our hiring, extensive background checks are conducted on applicants; however, because Mr. Padron was not convicted of the charges you referenced (or any other disqualifying criminal charges), he was cleared for employment,” Southwest Key spokeswoman Lizzie Chen told Texas Monthly. Texas state health regulators said they reported around 150 violations at more than a dozen migrant children shelters run by Southwest Key Programs following inspections, including one staff member who showed up to work drunk.

3	NONE	“In our hiring, extensive background checks are conducted on applicants; however, because Mr. Padron was not convicted of the charges you referenced (or any other disqualifying criminal charges), he was cleared for employment,” said Southwest Key spokeswoman Lizzie Chen. Regulators have cited Southwest Key in the past for failing to properly check the backgrounds of other employees at Texas shelters. Inspectors found at another shelter two years ago in Houston that two employees had not been checked through the State Child Abuse and Neglect registry, and Southwest Key also failed to renew background checks for five other employees. Six employees at a Montgomery County shelter had their background checks renewed late in 2016, and inspectors last year found a caregiver with access to children had failed a pre-employment drug test. “Southwest Key is federally contracted to run child immigration shelters by the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is a program of the Administration for Children and Families (ACF), which falls underneath the larger umbrella of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,” the magazine reported.

4	NONE	(Support Free Thought) - Brownsville, TX – A Border Patrol agent who was arrested on child pornography charges was given direct access to children when he was hired by an immigration shelter, according to reports detailing the conditions thousands of immigrant children are subjected to when they are separated from their parents and then detained in shelters across the country. Ernesto Padron worked as a United States Border Patrol agent for 13 years, up until he was arrested on second-degree felony charges for possession and promotion of child pornography. Even though Padron’s case was dismissed, his record is still publicly available, and the fact that he was ever charged with and found in possession of child pornography should have raised major red flags when he applied to work for the non-profit organization, Southwest Key. Southwest Key has attempted to defend its decision to hire Padron by claiming that the fact that he was never convicted of possessing child pornography made him eligible for employment. The case of Ernesto Padron is disturbing for a number of reasons—because an individual who is allegedly a pedophile with a history of promoting child pornography was never tried in court, and never received the sentence he may have deserved; because he could be one of many criminals who got away with abhorrent crimes while a county focused on nonviolent offenders and its district attorney engaged in bribery schemes; and because the overwhelming failure of the state led to an alleged pedophile having direct access to vulnerable children who were taken from their parents and treated like prisoners.	AGAINST	NONE
5	NONE	Ernesto Padron's arrest in 2010 was widely reported and easily verifiable, but when nonprofit child detention center operator Southwest Key hired him some years later to be a case manager, they failed to check his background adequately, resulting in someone who got out of child porn charges on a technicality being placed in daily close proximity to hundreds of vulnerable children, Texas Monthly, who broke the case, reported. As a result, by the time Cameron County's current district attorney, Luis Saenz, found the case in a backlog in 2013, the statute of limitations on Padron's charges had expired and he was released from custody, Texas Monthly reported. An emailed statement to Texas Monthly by a company spokesperson said the organization did eventually find out about Padron's past and immediately suspended him, although it is unclear when that suspension happened or for how long he'd been working at Southwest Key at that point. Padron would have been responsible for reunifying unaccompanied children with their relatives, interviewing minors, driving clients to facilitate program services and transporting clients to court appointments, attorney visits, and other appointment as required, Texas Monthly reported, based on a job description for the case manager position in Brownsville. Southwest Key got almost $500 million from the US federal government this year to operate its shelters, housing around 5,000 immigrant children in Texas, Arizona and California, the Dallas Morning News reported.

6	NONE	ALBUQUERQUE – Russell Young, 39, of Albuquerque, N.M., a prior sex offender who is serving a term of supervised release from a prior child pornography conviction, is facing new child pornography charges in a criminal complaint filed by the FBI in federal court in Las Cruces, N.M. Young made his initial appearance in federal court in Las Cruces, N.M., on June 18, 2018, and this morning, a U.S. Magistrate Judge in Las Cruces found probable cause to support the charges in the criminal complaint. If convicted on the distribution charge, Young faces an enhanced penalty of a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of 15 years and a maximum of 40 years instead of the otherwise applicable five to 20 years because of his prior child pornography conviction. If convicted on the possession charge, Young faces an enhanced penalty of a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of ten years and a maximum of 20 years instead of the otherwise applicable ten year maximum penalty because of his prior child pornography conviction. Assistant U.S. Attorney Alexander B. Shapiro of the U.S. Attorney’s Las Cruces Branch office is prosecuting the case as part of Project Safe Childhood, a nationwide initiative launched in May 2006 by the Department of Justice (DOJ) to combat the growing epidemic of child sexual exploitation and abuse. Under this initiative, the U.S. Attorney’s Office and federal law enforcement agencies work with New Mexico’s District Attorneys and state, local and tribal law enforcement agencies to target violent or repeat offenders primarily based on their prior criminal convictions for federal prosecution offenders with the goal of making communities in New Mexico safer places for people to live and work.

8	NONE	The Louisiana Special Victims Unit has conducted an undercover child exploitation investigation in relation to images of child sexual abuse. Foley was present at the home during the search conducted by Louisiana State Police, Louisiana Probation and Parole and the Beauregard Parish Sheriff’s Department. Evidence was found during the search which showed Foley had possession of child pornography, and distributed it as well. When asked if Foley had any connection to the juvenile victim, Anderson said it does not appear at the present time that Foley had any connection to the juvenile victim. The Louisiana State Police Special Victims Unit began their investigation earlier this month and is actively investigating the case.	AGAINST	NONE
9	NONE	Spanish authorities have dismantled a child pornography network exploiting minors, including Moroccan children, in the production of pornographic images and videos. The 12 were behind a network that produced and distributed pornographic films of minors via the internet. More than one million child pornography films were seized. A joint statement from the Spanish Civil Guard and the Catalan police, broadcast on Wednesday, June 20, reports that “a large part of the child pornographic material broadcast was produced by the criminal network itself, through the sexual exploitation of minors in a situation of socioeconomic precariousness, originating from the cities of Barcelona, Tortosa, Valencia and Morocco.” The manager contacted the police, who discovered a residence prepared for the recording of child pornography videos.

1	NONE	FOUR Queensland regions have broken through the full employment mark of 5 per cent, but there may be some tough times ahead for the state as crucial industries show significant falls in jobs. And nationally, Baby Boomers just don't want to give up their jobs. Nationally, the figures show Baby Boomers just don’t want to give up their jobs. The ABS figures are not seasonally or trend adjusted but they indicate the jobs growth in those four areas has reached a point where bottlenecks occur and companies find it hard to get the right staff. The ABS also released data on industries which showed a big fall in the number of jobs in healthcare and retail, both of which are big employers in Queensland.	AGAINST	NONE
2	NONE	Out of more than 15,000 Shelby County Schools students who took some kind of career and technical education, or CTE, courses in the 2015-2016 academic year, only 1 percent – roughly 150 – completed those classes to get some kind of work certification. “The data was really shocking,” SCS superintendent Dorsey Hopson said of the basic finding the school system’s CTE task force released last year. In the gap between spring break and the end of the school year, SCS was upgrading and restoring some CTE classrooms at several schools as the system adds about 40 to 50 CTE courses that correspond to “pathways” – a narrower group of career and technical training programs based on available jobs in the Memphis economy and the areas likely to be growth areas for jobs. The task force that authored the 2017 report sent review teams to evaluate CTE programs at eight high schools SCS selected as representative of the entire district. The vo-tech programs at Northside High School – which closed two years ago, long after its auto body shop and printing shops were mothballed – were brought up by those opposed to the school’s closing.

3	NONE	Older people in Ireland are highly involved with their family and in society, but many of them face significant challenges in negotiating the built environment and in accessing public transport. Some 85% of those aged 50-plus engage in one or more social leisure activities at least once a month. However, there is a heavy reliance on private cars for transport, with 70% driving a car every week (and 58% of these people are aged 70 and over). Meanwhile, 31% find it difficult to access public transport and this is more pronounced in rural areas, where it is a problem for 68%. Because of transport problems, one in four people find it difficult to socialise, to do essential tasks, or to keep health and social care appointments.	NONE	NONE
4	NONE	"It did not take long for St John to decide Middlemarch couple Merv and Joan Wilson were volunteer material. Almost 11 years later, Mr Wilson (76) and Mrs Wilson (72) still turn out for a 2pm-6pm Tuesday shift in Dunedin hospital’s emergency department, doing whatever they can to help: making beds, putting together meals, offering tea, or simply being someone to talk to. ""A lot of people want to come in for a while because they think it’s exciting, but it’s a job and we want you to commit for at least a year ... you need a bit of life experience as well, although we look for a diverse range of volunteers."" A roster of 60 St John volunteers work at Dunedin hospital, with 40 rostered on at emergency, the sole department where volunteers work every day. The health system brought Mr and Mrs Wilson together: they met when Mr Wilson was a driver for the blood transfusion service and Mrs Wilson was helping to make meals for blood donors."	NONE	NONE
5	NONE	Five strokes behind tournament host Steve Stricker after an opening 69 in rain Friday at University Ridge, Toledo had six birdies in a bogey-free round to reach 9-under 135. Stricker followed his opening 64 with a 74, ending his Champions under-par streak at 30 rounds — the fourth-longest streak in tour history. “That was a big birdie in my mind,” Stricker said. No one ran away with this thing today and three shots back, a lot of guys in between me and the lead. The 12-time PGA Tour winner played the big tour the last two weeks, tying for 18th in Memphis and tying for 20th in the U.S. Open.	FAVOR	NONE
6	NONE	For example, in a 30-day month, Southwest Airlines mandates that pilots take 15 reserve days. That means airline pilots work 20-hour weeks compared with the 40-hour weeks of 9-to-5 workers. Although they work the usual five 8-hour shifts of a 9-to-5 worker, they work at odd times. In fact, before night shifts, workers get an average of 2.3 hours of sleep. However, they also have significant downsides, like spending little time with family, working tough night shifts and working in a stressful environment.	AGAINST	NONE
7	NONE	Wyatt has taken many of the photographs in our special 50 Best BBQ Joints issues as well as plenty of other smoked-meat stories. Wyatt’s new book, Texas BBQ, Small Town to Downtown (University of Texas Press, August 1), takes us to a few slick urban spots, but it’s the out-of-the-way places that will likely stir more than an appetite in readers—they’ll stir a sense of adventure too. In the book’s photos, nine of which we’ve featured in these pages, Wyatt captures soot-stained pit houses and sturdy pitmasters who prove there’s plenty of old-time barbecue still to be discovered. Wyatt is a pioneer who has turned me on to more barbecue joints than anyone else I know. (And don't miss this Q with Wyatt about his new book with Texas Monthly photo editor Leslie Baldwin.)

8	NONE	But it’s not the type of AI you’ve come to expect from sci-fi classics such as HAL from “2001: A Space Odyssey,” said Shobhit Gupta, business strategy and operations lead for AllyO, a Silicon Valley-based company that specializes in AI for recruiting. And Google Hire, the recruiting product launched by the search giant in 2017 as part of its G Suite for work, announced new AI features during the SHRM Conference in Chicago this week. Both AllyO and Google Hire’s AI features help recruiters by taking on the task of checking schedules, finding available interviewers, booking rooms and assisting interviewers in preparing for an interview. Google Hire announced their product’s AI features will auto-highlight resumes and match skills from the job description with keywords from a resume to help recruiters efficiently slice through the high volume of candidates they have to review for open positions. While machine learning is helping recruiters better manage their talent acquisition process, the ultimate aim is to rehumanize the recruiting experience, Gupta said, by putting control back in the hands of both recruiters and candidates.

9	NONE	When you'll get better benefits Workplace benefits are an important part of your overall compensation package, so if you're looking at a lower salary from a company whose perks are outstanding, that's reason enough to consider that offer. When you'll enjoy a more favorable company culture Company culture can play a huge role in your day-to-day satisfaction on the job, so if taking a hit on salary means being happier at the office, it's probably a hit worth taking. Not being content with their company culture is actually the No. 1 reason younger workers quit their jobs today, so if you're offered the chance to work in an environment where employees are valued and respected, it pays to go for it. Before you rush to take that job with the highest salary, think about the perks that might come along with making a bit less money.

10	NONE	Pastoral Care Services Worker and inmate Kao Saephanh (L) helps inmate Joseph Morrow, 69, who has bladder cancer, take a shower in the hospice at the California Medical Facility prison in Vacaville, California, U.S., May 22, 2018. The 38-year-old former gang member, serving a sentence of 41 years to life for second-degree murder when he was 16, says it is that fear which helps him empathize with the terminally ill inmates he looks after at a California prison hospice. Murillo's work in the 17-bed hospice unit at the medium-security California Medical Facility in Vacaville, about 55 miles (88.51 km) northeast of San Francisco, includes helping dying prisoners take a shower or go to the bathroom. Reuters visited two California prisons recently to look at the challenges states face, as improved medical care, long sentences from tougher crime laws, and a steady increase of older adults entering prison has contributed to an extraordinary rise of elderly inmates. The 25 inmate workers and volunteers, who are known as Pastoral Care Workers, received 70 hours of training, mostly in video form, in a curriculum directed by the prison's chaplain, Keith Knauf.

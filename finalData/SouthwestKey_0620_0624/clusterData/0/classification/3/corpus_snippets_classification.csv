Thad Allen, left, and an unidentified man, help lift up a downed power line during a tour of downtown New Orleans with, from third left, Lousiana Gov. Kathleen Blanco, President George W. Bush, Lt. Gen. Russell Honore and New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin. ... Americans are now seeing precisely what they saw back in 2005, when New Orleans was underwater: the real human toll of an inept and careless leader. The inevitable result is that Americans are now seeing precisely what they saw back in 2005, when New Orleans was underwater: the real human toll of an inept and careless leader. The president of the United States directed federal employees to abduct thousands of innocent children and scatter them to the wind with no thought as to how these children might find their parents again. And Americans with any shred of decency will come to see Trump for what he is: a loud and incompetent failure, a man so reckless that he created his own Katrina and so engorged by self-pity that he will look past the children altogether, and instead regard himself as its central victim.

2	NONE	Saturday PUNCH asked some men and women about their opinion on who owns the woman’s money in a home Two shall become one, so they should share everything – Kash A Philemon From the Biblical point of view, precisely Genesis chapter 2 verse 19 to the end, in this chapter of the Bible, you will discover that when God created man- Adam, God discovered that there was a missing link in man that was not complete; and God caused man a deep sleep to remove one of his ribs and he created a woman. It is not compulsory for a woman to share her money – Ghazali Abdulhammed It is the woman’s money, according to Islamic shariah; men are in the position to take care of their women in marriage. If she feels like contributing to the welfare of the home, then she can but the main responsibility of a man to his wife is to do everything for her; he doesn’t have to look at her own money at all. As Christians, a couple should share everything together – Ifeoma Ibeh In a marriage, the woman’s money belongs to the woman. God is the author of marriage, so if God says two shall become one; it means that the man and the woman are supposed to own everything together in marriage.	AGAINST	NONE
3	NONE	CNN's Jeffrey Toobin and Brian Karem (Screen cap). A CNN panel on Thursday said it would be unfair to say that the Trump administration’s family separation policy scandal is on par with the Bush administration’s handling of Hurricane Katrina — but only because what Trump has done is much worse. “A metaphor we are starting to hear more and more is this is Donald Trump’s Katrina, a turning point in how he is portrayed,” said CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin. Toobin went on to explain that Hurricane Katrina was a crisis that was foisted upon the Bush administration, whereas the family separation policy is entirely of the Trump administration’s own making. CNN political analyst Brian Karem agreed that this scandal is worse than Katrina for Trump and he said it’s emblematic of how his entire administration is being run.	AGAINST	NONE
4	NONE	The MSNBC host said that the current administration’s cruel and inhumane policy on the southern border of the United States is their version of George W. Bush’s Hurricane Katrina. “We’re under the next Republican presidency after George W. Bush, and our current catastrophe now is not an act of god like Katrina was,” Maddow said. And our current catastrophe now is not an act of god like Katrina was. But our current national harrowing moral catastrophe that is driving people to distraction is this new thing that the Trump administration started doing weeks ago, which has resulted in the mass separation of little kids and babies from their mothers and fathers. The parallels should terrify Trump Like the poorly managed Hurricane Katrina disaster, the political ramifications of the Trump-created crisis at the border will be severe.	AGAINST	NONE

7	NONE	Authorities claim Roland Bourgeois Jr. shot at three black men, wounding one, after he and others discussed protecting the Algiers neighborhood, in New Orleans, following Hurricane Katrina, in 2005. The trial has been delayed more than a dozen times over questions concerning Bourgeois’ mental fitness to participate in his own defense. Here is more on the case from The New Orleans Advocate: Details about Bourgeois’ health have remained largely under seal, though Lemmon remarked that the defendant was “physically incompetent” to stand trial before postponing the case indefinitely in August 2014. Bourgeois, who had been free on bond since his initial arrest, was taken into custody again in August of last year, charged with a bond violation. Investigative journalist A.C. Thompson exposed the allegations made against Bourgeois months before federal prosecutors first filed charges in the case.	AGAINST	NONE
8	NONE	George is the man who has been called a hero for using the gun he carries to stop the bizarre and deadly rampage of carjackings and shootings by McCleary resident Tim O. Day that ultimately injured three people, one critically. On Wednesday morning, standing at a podium just outside the church’s open front doors in this town of about 685 people, George read a statement detailing his account of Sunday’s chaotic scene. He watched Day shoot twice into the driver’s side of a vehicle, critically injuring a man, and start to move toward where George thought his family might be. George told Zamora to stay with Day while he retrieved a medical kit from his own vehicle, and administered aid to the injured man in the car. Flanked Wednesday by his wife and Oakville Fire Chief Bill Rodocker, George said he had been cleared of any wrongdoing in Day’s shooting, and had held off making public statements for several reasons, including giving authorities time to investigate.

9	NONE	The Grammy-nominated singer has created Akoin, which will be used as part of an Akoin Ecosystem, where consumers will be able to buy, hold and spend the cryptocurrency from their smartphone through a suite of blockchain-powered apps. This will all take place inside what claims to be the world’s first completely cryptocurrency-based city – conveniently named Akon Crypto City – which is currently under development in the African country. According to the Akoin website, the city will be built on “2,000 acres of land gifted to Akon from the President of Senegal, is within five minutes of the new international airport, close to the coast and a short drive from Dakar, the capital city of Senegal”. The site says the aim of the city will be to blend its crypto infrastructure with other aspects of smart cities to create what it calls a “radical new way of existence”. The singer has a history when it comes to technological philanthropy, having previously founded the Akon Lighting Africa project, which has so far created and scaled solar power solutions in 18 African countries.

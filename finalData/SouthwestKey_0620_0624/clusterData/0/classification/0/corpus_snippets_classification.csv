1	NONE	Sanchez grew up poor in the border town of Brownsville, “where life was full of challenges,” according to a 2007 Southwest Key annual report. Sanchez began Southwest Key in 1987 in Austin, and within 20 years it became “one of the country’s largest care providers for unaccompanied immigrant children and juvenile justice system-involved youth,” the annual report says. In the 2007 report, Sanchez noted a significant increase in demand for shelter for unaccompanied immigrant children. “We opened over 100 new shelter beds this year, making Southwest Key the largest provider of services for these children in the country. The following year, 2008, the federal government began funding the Unaccompanied Alien Children Program and Southwest Key grew further.	NONE	NONE
2	NONE	"One company providing shelter for thousands of migrant children that have come before and after the zero tolerance policy is Southwest Key Inc. Here’s are a few things to know about Southwest Key: It’s a nonprofit organization that, according to its website “contracts with government agencies and private foundations to operate three types of programs throughout the country: youth justice programs, charter schools for kids in underserved neighborhoods, and shelters for immigrant youth. According to Bloomberg, Southwest Key has the most lucrative contract with the federal government and will be paid the “most among the organizations, government agencies and companies that run a detention and care system for immigrant children on behalf of the Department of Health and Human Services.” Southwest Key runs 26 immigrant children’s shelters in Texas, Arizona and California. It also operates in four other states, Georgia, New York, Wisconsin and Florida The company issued a statement about the policy of separating migrant children from their parents saying: ""Southwest Key Programs does not support separating families at the border."

3	NONE	HARLINGEN, Texas – The business of housing, transporting and watching over migrant children detained along the southwest border is not a multimillion-dollar business. The nonprofit Southwest Key Programs has won at least $955 million in federal contracts since 2015 to run shelters and provide other services to immigrant children in federal custody. Its shelter for migrant boys at a former Walmart Supercenter in South Texas has been the focus of nationwide scrutiny, but Southwest Key is but one player in the lucrative, secretive world of the migrant-shelter business. And President Donald Trump's order Wednesday calling for migrant families to be detained together likely means millions more in contracts for private shelter operators, construction companies and defense contractors. BCFS, a global network of nonprofit groups, has received at least $179 million in federal contracts since 2015 under the government's so-called unaccompanied alien children program, designed to handle migrant youths who arrive in the country without a parent or other family member.

4	NONE	The shelter in Glendale is one of around a dozen in Arizona run by the nonprofit Southwest Key that has taken in immigrant youth under a Trump administration directive to separate families who cross the border. In February 2017, an investigator with the Arizona Department of Health Services evaluated a Southwest Key shelter in Glendale — a gated house on Myrtle Avenue that has a soccer net in the backyard. These new Southwest Key shelters will probably look more like the nonprofit's detention shelter in an abandoned Texas Walmart, where officials allowed reporters to enter last week. In addition to the Myrtle Avenue facility's penalty for restraining a child, other Southwest Key facilities in Arizona struggling to meet the deadlines for renewing their registrations with AZDHS. Like other Southwest Key facilities, the Myrtle Avenue shelter is surrounded by a fence and has an automatic gate.	AGAINST	NONE

While Southwest Key has garnered attention because of the Trump administration’s policy of breaking up families at the border, only 10 percent of children in its facilities were separated from their relatives.

If there is a migrant-shelter hub in America, then it is perhaps in the four-county Rio Grande Valley region of South Texas, where about a dozen shelters occupy former stores, schools and medical centers.

8	NONE	The Trump administration is paying Southwest Key $458 million to run immigrant child detention centers, and its CEO earns a $1.5 million salary. In late June 2018, a series of investigative news reports exposed the fact that Juan Sanchez, the chief executive of non-profit Southwest Key, was making a salary of $1.5 million while his organization had scored $458 million in federal grants to shelter detained children who had been taken from their parents at the southern U.S. border. The figures were taken from a 19 June 2018 Bloomberg report: The nonprofit, Southwest Key Programs Inc., is to be paid more than $458 million in fiscal 2018, according to the data — the most among the organizations, government agencies and companies that run a detention and care system for immigrant children on behalf of the Department of Health and Human Services. We independently confirmed with tax records publicly available through the non-profit tracking site Guidestar.org and public financial data posted by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which oversees programs for unaccompanied immigrant children, that the figures reported by Bloomberg are accurate. Many of those children were placed at Southwest Key facilities, including Casa Padre, a converted WalMart in Brownsville, Texas reportedly holding 1,500.	AGAINST	NONE
9	NONE	The Trump administration is set to pay a Texas nonprofit nearly a half billion dollars this year to house migrant children who were detained crossing the border illegally, according to government data. Southwest Key Programs will receive $458 million in fiscal year 2018, more than any other organization that contracts with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to run shelters for migrant kids. Since 1997, the Southwest Key has housed thousands of migrant children who crossed the border without adult relatives, and today it operates 27 migrant shelters in Texas, California and Arizona. It has led to a spike in the number of migrant children turned over to HHS, and many of them have been sent to Southwest Key facilities.

10	NONE	In nearly all cases, the federal government has continued to place migrant children with the companies even after serious allegations were raised and after state inspectors cited shelters with serious deficiencies. Allegations included staff members’ failure to seek medical attention for children. In another shelter, staff gave a child medicine to which she was allergic, despite a warning on her medical bracelet. Inspectors also cited homes for “inappropriate contact” between children and staff, including a case in which a staff member gave children a pornographic magazine. In dozens of cases reviewed by Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting and The Texas Tribune, federal officials continued sending children who crossed the border to the shelters after the incidents came to light.

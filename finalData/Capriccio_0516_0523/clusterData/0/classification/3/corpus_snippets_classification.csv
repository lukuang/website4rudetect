1	NONE	"The Tax Chamber of the First-Tier Tribunal (FTT) ruled in 2016 that Aria Taheri, the Manchester-based firm’s sole director, “must have known of the connection to fraud” when his company took part in a series of sales that ended up depriving HM Revenue and Customs of £758,770.69. Tribunal Judge Jennifer Dean found (PDF, 93 pages) that Aria supplied tech goods to a number of small firms that reclaimed the VAT without being able to show proper accounts backing up their claims – including one registered business whose director, in the judge’s words, ""had become interested in the trade after a meeting with two men in a nightclub who told him about it"". The firm's arguments have boiled down to assertions that HMRC's case was contradictory; that the judge took a one-sided view of the evidence against Aria; and that the judge did not take all of the evidence into account and had selectively quoted Taheri. For its part, HMRC argued in its written response to Aria that its ""grounds of appeal attempt to reopen the findings of fact, paragraph by paragraph, in the decision of the FTT"" and that ""these attempts to do not meet the legal requirements for such a challenge"". Taheri told The Register: ""Of course I believe that Aria Technology Ltd (ATL) is innocent and I strongly feel that if the decision has gone against ATL, then it should be through employing a fair reasoning process - something that ATL is entitled to."

2	NONE	"A carousel of VAT-dodging allegations In 2016 Aria had lost a First-Tier Tribunal tax case against HMRC, with the tribunal ruling that Aria Technology had dodged £750,000 in VAT through a so-called VAT carousel scheme, or missing trader intra-community (MTIC) fraud, as the lawyers call it. I reject your rules and substitute my own When the tribunal told him about El Reg's request to view the case papers, Aria Technology Ltd's (ATL) sole director, Aria Taheri, made a formal application to stop its clerks from revealing ATL's ""grounds of appeal"", which is the legal document setting out in detail why it thinks the FTT was wrong to side with HMRC, and HMRC's formal ""response"" to the grounds. Reg reporter Corfield cited a previous legal case, Guardian v Westminster Magistrates, in which the Court of Appeal ruled: ""Broadly speaking, the requirements of open justice apply to all tribunals exercising the judicial power of the state."" On ATL's behalf, Taheri urged the judge not to release the documents, telling the tribunal that when his company's dispute with HMRC came to public light in August 2014, its bank blocked the Aria corporate account for 12 days, leaving the firm ""short of funds and unable to pay key suppliers when invoices fell due"". As Judge Sinfield said in his published judgment, rejecting this argument: In my view, Mr Taheri has not demonstrated that allowing Mr Corfield and The Register access to ATL's notice of appeal and grounds and HMRC's response would lead to any unfairness or is likely to cause ATL or any other person real harm... it is clear that the bank resumed crediting the payments to ATL's account while the hearing was ongoing and continued to do so notwithstanding the subsequent release of the Decision in which the FTT found that ATL, through Mr Taheri and others, knew or ought to have known that it was engaging in transactions connected with the fraudulent evasion of VAT."

3	NONE	Lawyers for Jodi Arias Arizona (left, undated mug shot) asked the Arizona Court of Appeals on Friday to bar the public from having access to the opening brief in her appeal against a 2013 for murdering her boyfriend Travis Alexander (pictured together, right, in undated shot) 'The contents of the opening brief may endanger some members of the public, given the continuing interest in this case by the public and the media,' they wrote. The case was marked by secrecy after the first trial, which turned into a media circus as salacious and violent details about Arias and Alexander were broadcast live around the world. These included Alexander's desire for Arias (seen in an undated photo in custody) to wear boy's underwear and have sex in his office Arias' highly publicized trial detailing all the kinks and fetishes the two had been involved in. In the sentencing retrial, Stephens repeatedly held secret hearings and kicked members of the public out of the courtroom as the first witness called in Arias' defense took the stand. Arias (pictured in court on April 13, 2015) initially told a bizarre story of masked intruders breaking into the home and killing Alexander while she cowered in fear before changing her story to claim self-defense At the time, the judge didn't reveal the witness' identity, saying only that the decision to close the courtroom was difficult but necessary because the witness wouldn't otherwise testify in public.

4	NONE	"Melbourne-based computer retailer PC-Tek, formally registered as XXIT Pty Ltd, has sought the services of Dye Co on 17 May following a voluntary winding-up order. PC-Tek also has another $14,400 owed to the ATO’s superannuation guarantee section, plus $18,000 in holiday pay claims by the company’s employees, for a total of more than $32,000 in employee entitlements. In 2016, PC-Tek settled with Microsoft out of court before the copyright infringement claim was escalated to formal court proceedings. The company also admitted to pirating copies of Windows 7 Professional by peeling off authenticity stickers from second-hand PCs, putting them onto new computers, then activating the unauthorised software for resale. ""Microsoft's investigators purchased a new computer system from XXIT which had a Multinational Account Original Equipment Manufacturer Certificate of Authenticity attached, and an unauthorised copy of Windows 7 Professional installed,"" the vendor said at the time."

5	NONE	A public sector IT contractor has won his appeal against Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs to pay £26,000 in back taxes under IR35 legislation. HMRC said Wells' contract should fall within the scope of IR35 because his work was not casual, as he engaged almost continuously for over 10 months, and was obliged to turn up for work each day and worked the core hours of 8am/9am until 6pm. IR35 hit the headlines recently after a number of BBC presenters appealed their tax bills under the legislation, claiming they were pressured by the BBC to engage via personal service companies. Last year the government shifted responsibility for compliance with the IR35 legislation from the individual contractor to the public body or recruitment agency. The case was brought to the First-Tier Tribunal Chamber represented by IR35 specialist, Qdos Contractor, which acted on behalf of Wells.	NONE	NONE

7	NONE	PTI has accessed a letter written recently by the CBDT to all its regional chiefs stating that the tax department is an “aggrieved creditor” vis-a-vis these struck-off shell companies and the taxman should hence undertake all efforts to file these petitions to get its dues from them. A standard operating procedure (SOP) has been issued by the CBDT last year for the tax department for filing such appeals that stated that shell firms against whom the department has pending cases of departmental appeal, penalty and prosecution among others will be petitioned before the NCLT. The CBDT said that the Ministry of Corporate Affairs has informed it about issuing “suitable directions to all regional directors and Registrar of Companies (RoCs) to extend cooperation to the tax department while filing applications for restoration of name of struck off/de-registered companies before the jurisdictional NCLT bench.” The ministry has also told the CBDT that its regional directors and RoCs will “not oppose” the tax department‘s applications before the NCLT. The CBDT said it has also requested the ministry to intimate the regional RoCs to ensure issue of “public notice” of striking off or de-registration of companies to the designated nodal officers of the tax department in the country.

9	NONE	Serving serving a life sentence for a murder conviction in the 2008 death of her former boyfriend Travis Alexander, Arias is asking a court to bar the public from viewing the opening brief in the appeal of her conviction. (Arizona Department of Corrections via AP, file) PHOENIX — Jodi Arias’ lawyers say the upcoming appeal of her murder conviction in the 2008 killing of her ex-boyfriend should be kept secret because the trial records remain sealed and public interest in her case remains extremely high. Those arguments are in a reply to prosecutors’ objections to Arias’ pending request for a court order to file her initial brief due June 6 under seal. Prosecutors have argued there’s a legal presumption that appeals will be public and that Arias’ lawyers didn’t adequately explain why the appeal brief should be sealed. Arias’ reply filed Wednesday cites previous court orders requiring that case records be kept from the public.	FAVOR	NONE

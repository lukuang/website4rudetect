""Capriccio is made from 100 percent natural fruit juices and grape wine with no additives or preservatives,"" Dave Steiner, National Sales Director at Florida Caribbean Distillers, tells Men'sHealth.com. Capriccio boasts an alcohol content of 13.9 percent alcohol by volume, meaning nearly 14 percent of the drink is pure alcohol."	FAVOR	NONE

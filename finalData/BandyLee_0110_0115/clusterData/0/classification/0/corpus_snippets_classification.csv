1	NONE	The Yale University psychology professor who called President Trump “mentally impaired” appears to lack a valid license to practice psychiatry in her home state of Connecticut. The prominent professor Bandy Lee made the headlines over the past few days when she made a diagnosis of the president as suffering from a “mental impairment” that would disqualify him from the highest office in the land. “We at the APA call for an end to psychiatrists providing professional opinions in the media about public figures whom they have not examined, whether it be on cable news appearances, books, or in social media,” wrote the APA, without mentioning Lee specifically. Lee and her colleague responded to the issue in a piece to Politico on Wednesday, in which they claimed it is “perfectly OK to question the president’s mental state” because of their profession as “psychiatrists.” Campus Reform reports that state records indicate that Lee’s “physician/surgeon” license expired some three years ago — on May 31, 2015 — and that her application for reinstatement has been pending ever since.

2	NONE	Following Lee’s comments, the American Psychiatric Association released a statement on Tuesday warning members of its profession to refrain from making public diagnoses of public figures like Trump without a proper medical exam. The Goldwater rule is the informal name given to Section 7 in the American Psychiatric Association’s (APA) Principles of Medical Ethics that states it is unethical for psychiatrists to give a professional opinion about public figures they have not examined in person and from whom they have not obtained consent to discuss their mental health in public statements. “We at the APA call for an end to psychiatrists providing professional opinions in the media about public figures whom they have not examined, whether it be on cable news appearances, books, or in social media,” wrote the APA, without mentioning Lee specifically.

3	NONE	Authored by Anthony Gockowski via Campus Reform, Yale University psychology professor Bandy Lee has deleted her Twitter account amid mounting allegations that she is not licensed in her home state of Connecticut. Accusations have been circulating on Twitter that the prominent Yale professor, known for her public diagnosis of President Donald Trump as having a “mental impairment” and who recently met with lawmakers on Capitol Hill to discuss the issue, isn’t actually a licensed psychiatrist. In fact, Campus Reform discovered that according to the State of Connecticut, Lee’s “physician/surgeon” license expired in 2015, and her application for reinstatement has been “pending” ever since. Without mentioning Lee specifically, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) put out a recent statement in which it condemned the diagnoses of public officials whom psychiatrists have not personally examined, invoking what is commonly referred to as the Goldwater Rule. Lee and a colleague, however, responded to criticisms in a Wednesday POLITICO piece, in which they claim that “it’s perfectly OK to question the president’s mental state,” since they are “psychiatrists.”	NONE	NONE
4	NONE	A psychiatrist who claimed to have briefed more than a dozen U.S. lawmakers on President Trump’s mental state – demanding an “emergency” evaluation and even restraint by force of the president – may not even have a license in her home state of Connecticut. As WND reported, Bandy Lee, an assistant professor in forensic psychiatry at the Yale School of Medicine and author of “The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump,” says she briefed Democrats and one Republican on Trump’s mental health status on Dec. 5 and 6. Lee even insisted no “serious” psychiatrist would say Trump isn’t “dangerous.” Since Lee’s statements were made public, the American Psychiatric Association released a statement urging psychiatrists to stop trying to evaluate Trump when they’ve never even examined him. It’s our duty to question the president’s mental state,” Lee claimed “it’s perfectly OK to question the president’s mental state” because she’s a “psychiatrist.”	AGAINST	NONE

In response to Campus Reform’s inquiry on the matter, Lee simply stated that “I need only one license,” though she has yet to elaborate on precisely which license that is, and, according to the state in which she resides, she allegedly has none. Without mentioning Lee specifically, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) put out a recent statement in which it condemned the diagnoses of public officials whom psychiatrists have not personally examined, invoking what is commonly referred to as the Goldwater Rule.

6	NONE	Donald Trump and his White House, reeling from depictions in Michael Wolff’s instant bestseller Fire and Fury, were desperate this week to show that the president is in command and mentally fit, following up on Trump’s tweet in response to the book last weekend claiming he is a “stable genius.” In Fire And Fury, Wolff quoted people in the White House calling Trump an “idiot” and a “moron.” — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 11, 2018 It reportedly took a phone call from House Speaker Paul Ryan to convince Trump that the program was focused on foreign surveillance (though it can wiretap American citizens communicating with those outside the country), leading the president to flip an hour later and tweet support for the program ― again, a program that his own White House already supported, a fact about which he seemed to be completely out of touch. The debate about Trump’s emotional stability ended a long time ago, though this week, because of the Wolff book and the responses to it, Trump’s stability seemed to get conflated with other things that became easier for the administration to challenge, with the help of some gullible or access-driven journalists. No matter his mental health, in a week in which Trump and the White House were intent on pushing back against Fire and Fury and presenting the president as stable and mentally fit, he displayed, in spectacular fashion, his uncontrolled and bigoted rage, his impulsiveness and his instability.

In a televised cabinet meeting on Thursday, meant to lay out the administration’s and the GOP’s priorities for 2018, Trump suddenly announced that his administration would take “a strong look” at tightening libel laws ― though there actually are no federal libel laws ― something that no Republican in Congress is likely to have any interest in addressing at a time when they’d like to talk up having passed their tax bill and focus on other priorities.

The hospital was already the only psych facility on probation with the state because of past safety violations. “Moving toward license revocation is absolutely warranted here,” said Carrie Williams, spokeswoman for the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, which oversees psychiatric hospitals. “We have to hold hospitals accountable, especially when patient rights and safety are concerned.

11	NONE	Donald Trump will submit himself for his first health checkup as president this afternoon. Trump is getting his first medical checkup since taking office, a head-to-toe exam on Friday as questions swirl about the health and fitness of the oldest person ever elected to the nation's highest office. When asked about it, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said questions about Trump's health were 'frankly, pretty ridiculous' and blamed his slurred speech on a dry throat, 'nothing more than that.' In September 2016, during the presidential campaign, Trump released a five-paragraph letter from Dr. Harold Bornstein, his longtime physician, in which the gastroenterologist concluded that Trump 'is in excellent physical health.' On Tuesday, the White House made a point of opening Trump's lengthy immigration meeting with lawmakers to reporters and TV cameras, a rare public look lasting nearly an hour at the president conducting a policy gathering.

12	NONE	Another previous study — led by Prof. Philippe Froguel, who is chair of genomic medicine at Imperial College London (ICL) in the United Kingdom — found that variants in three genes accounted for 30 percent of the severe obesity cases identified in a Pakistani population. The same team of ICL researchers have now chosen to focus on a group of Pakistani children with extreme obesity from consanguineous families, or those that descend from the same ancestor, in an attempt to single out a specific gene mutation. As the authors of the new study explain, so-called recessive mutations are responsible for the link between obesity and genes. The new study — which was recently published in the journal Nature Genetics — suggests that mutations in a gene called adenylate cyclase 3 (ADCY3) lead to obesity. Additionally, using the GeneMatcher website, Prof. Froguel and colleagues found another patient — this time of European-American descent — who had inherited different ADCY3 mutations from both parents and who also had obesity.

18	NONE	“I probably have a very good relationship with Kim Jong-un,” Trump told the paper. Trump’s remarks were published under the headline “Donald Trump Signals Openness to North Korea Diplomacy in Interview,” which gives the impression that they were part of some coherent strategy. It’s possible Trump is trying to send the message that he embraces North Korea’s new attempts at diplomacy. Later in the interview, Trump suggested that even if he and Kim don’t have a great relationship right now, that may change very soon. Not because they’ve talked, or because that’s the new U.S. strategy – that’s just the strange nature of being friends with Trump.	FAVOR	NONE
